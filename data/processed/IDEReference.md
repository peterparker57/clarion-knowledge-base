Multiple Clarion Version Support 
The Clarion IDE supports version switching for all projects and applications. 
For hand coded projects, you can switch versions at any time. If you are switching versions for applications, the 
application must be closed prior to switching versions (due to the template registry processing that is required). 
From the IDE Menu, select Build > Set Clarion Version to switch versions. Versions are auto-detected by the IDE, but 
you may also manually add versions through the Tools > Options > Clarion > Clarion for Windows > Options dialog.  
See: Tools Options: Clarion - Clarion for Windows - Versions  
When working with applications and multiple versions, each version uses a separate registry file. When switching versions 
for the first time, you will have to register the templates that will be used for that version. Use the Tools > Edit Template 
Registry menu item to do this. 
Here is a step-by-step guide to working with C7 applications using the C6 template registry and compiler: 
1. Start the IDE. 
2. Switch to the C6 version (Build > Set Clarion Version) 
3. Go to Tools > Edit Template Registry 
4. Register the needed C6 templates. 
5. Load the target C6 application (if the application has not been previously converted). 
6. After conversion and loading, you should now be able to Build and Run (if an executable target) a C6 version of 
the application from the C7 IDE.

General Tips Using the New IDE 
Current Directory 
In Clarion 6 and prior versions, you could select the current directory, and every time you opened a file, the file dialog 
would start in that directory. 
In Clarion Win32 and higher, the APP no longer sets the current directory. This is necessary because you now have 
solutions that contain multiple applications each of which can be in a different directory. 
So the question then is, when I open a file in which directory will the file dialog start in? 
The answer depends on what is active in the IDE. 
If you are opening a project/solution or application, then the file dialog always starts in your default project location as 
specified in Tools/Options/General/Projects and Solutions dialog. 
If you open a file via File/Open/File or CTRL+O then the initial directory will be the directory that the currently active tab's 
file is found. If there are no open tabs, then the directory will be the directory of the currently active project/application. If 
no solution is loaded, then the initial directory will be the directory where the IDE was started from. 
  
Designer Related Tips 
Custom Color dialog 
For each property that requires a color attribute, there is a drop list that displays a variety of default colors to select from. 
However, if you need to choose a custom color, select the Custom tab, and RIGHT-CLICK on any color element in the 
bottom two rows of this dialog.

Multi-DLL projects 
 The following topic documents the sequence of recommended steps needed to link a multi-DLL source code solution. 
Overview 
The Clarion project system has been updated and upgraded to use the MSBuild project engine. MSBuild is the new 
extensible, XML-based build engine that ships with the .NET Framework 2.0 
How to create a Multi-DLL Project 
To create a multi-DLL project, you will need to create a solution which references all the DLLs and Executables that are 
needed. Here is a step-by-step quick-start guide to this process: 
Note: This sequence applies to a hand coded multi-DLL project, or projects that have been exported from an application. 
The sequence of creating a multi-DLL solution from existing applications will vary slightly. 
1. Locate the main project file (the .PRJ file) of the multi-DLL project, and open it in the IDE. This should be the project file 
that creates the executable (EXE). To do this, select Open > Solution, Project or Application from the IDE File menu. 
The Project File Conversion dialog will be displayed at this time. For example: 
 
Press Yes to find a matching project (PRJ) for all of the library files that are detected. This will complete the multi-DLL 
project import, and you can now skip down to step 8.  
If you are not sure if a corresponding project exists for a library, or wish to manually import your project references, press 
No in the Project File Conversion dialog, and proceed to step 2. 
2. In the Projects window, right click on the project node, and select Add > Referenced Projects... . 
3. In the selection dialog, click on the cwproj Browser tab. 
4. Click on the Browse button. 
5. In the Select project(s) to reference file dialog used to select a project change the file filter to Legacy Clarion Project 
Files. 
6. At this time you can add all DLL projects needed by performing a multi-select in the Select project(s) to reference 
dialog. 
7. Click OK to go back to the Add Reference dialog, and click OK again to close this dialog window. 
This will convert all the projects to Clarion .cwproj files, add the projects as references, and add them to the new solution. 
The MSBuild engine will automatically resolve priorities and references from this point. 
8. Build the solution (Build > Build Solution). If you have already built the solution before, you may want to "clean" the 
solution first (Build > Clean Solution). 
Clarion creates three sub-folders with every solution, located in the project folder. They are BIN, MAP and OBJ. In each of 
these folders, you will see Debug or Release (or both), depending on the configuration mode that you have selected. 
Cleaning a solution removes all files from these sub-folders.

Development Environment (IDE) 
 
IDE Document Conventions 
Many areas of the IDE are divided into tabbed document areas. Example of this are the Start Page, Text Editor, and 
Dictionary Editor Quick View. 
If a document tab is marked with an asterisk (*), it indicates that the document or section has changed and needs to be 
saved. 
If a document tab is marked with a plus sign (+), it indicates that the document or section is currently in a read-only state, 
and cannot be modified. This can happen in a dictionary file if the user has read-only rights.

General Setup and Navigation 
 
Core IDE Elements 
Clarion’s development environment is a program that helps you write other programs. The development environment 
manages all the files (source code, executables, resources, etc.) and all the processes (editing, compiling, linking, etc.) 
needed to successfully develop Windows programs. The Getting Started and Learning Clarion books provide a wonderful 
general introduction to Clarion’s development environment. 
The tab controls on the Pick List, and New and Open menu options, redirect you to the core components of the Clarion 
IDE (Integrated Development Environment): 
  
Application (*.app) 
Selecting the Application tab control or menu item, and opening a file with a .APP extension, starts the Application 
Generator. By convention, a Clarion application refers to a project whose source code is generated by templates and 
whose instructions for compiling and linking are stored within the application file (.APP), rather than in a separate Project 
System file (.PRJ).

Selecting the Dictionary tab control or menu item, and opening a file with a .DCT extension, starts the Dictionary Editor. 
Data Dictionaries are created and maintained here. The Data Dictionary is the central repository for information about 
your application’s tables, columns, keys, and relationships. The information stored includes how and where the data is 
stored on disk, as well as how the data is presented to end users on reports and computer screen. This will usually be the 
first place to visit when starting a new project. 
Project 
By convention, a Clarion project includes some set of source code, plus the instructions (.PRJ file) for compiling and 
linking to produce an executable program. Project typically refers to a manually coded program rather than a template 
generated program. The Clarion Project System visually manages the project information. It maintains tree diagrams of 
the source files, external libraries, resources, and other project components. 
Database 
Clarion support a wide variety of database formats. This tab control provides access to the Database Browser, which in 
turn provides you to direct access to tables without the need of creating an application. The Database Browser is 
designed to allow developers free access to their tables. 
As you open a particular table, you will need to select the particular database type (i.e., TopSpeed, Pervasive, MS-SQL, 
ODBC, etc.). The information provided to you in the Database Browser varies with different database drivers. 
Source 
This tab control accesses the Text Editor. If you allow the Application Generator to write most of your source code, you 
will probably only use the Text Editor to write your embedded source code (see Embedded Source Dialog). If you write 
your own source code "from scratch", you will probably use the Text Editor extensively to create and manage your code. 
In addition, the Project System is integrated into the Text Editor, allowing you to effortlessly generate executables, 
libraries, and dynamic linked libraries (DLL). 
Report 
Selecting the Report tab control, and selecting or opening a file with a .TXR extension, starts the Clarion Report Writer. 
The Clarion Report Writer lets you create sophisticated reports from your data files, without the need of creating an 
application. See the Report Writer documentation for more information. 
All 
Selecting this tab provides you with a history of all files that you have accessed in the Clarion IDE. Selecting a file results 
in a "smart" open, redirecting you to the correct area of the environment.

may recognize this as the new "Pick List". This window is always displayed by default, unless you have activated the 
option of loading a default project. 
The Start Page dialog lists all of the most recently used files in a list box categorized (filtered) by Solutions (Projects and 
Applications), Dictionaries, Diagrams, Tables, and Source Files. See Core IDE Elements for an expanded explanation 
of each of these categories. 
  
Each of these categories displays a pick list of the most recently used files of that type: 
The Start Page also provides the following options for each section: 
Open  
Lets you open a file not on the Start Page list.

Template Registry Dialog 
This window is opened from the IDE Tools Menu (Tools > Edit Template Registry) 
Template files (*.TPL) drive the Application Generator. Each procedure template contains generic or "model" code. The 
templates are interactive--they process the information you specify when you design the application within the IDE. 
Clarion evaluates the template file twice: 
1. Before creating your application, Clarion pre-processes the template file and stores the information in the 
TemplateRegistry.TRF file. Pre-processing occurs only when the Application Generator detects a new or changed 
template. 
When it pre-processes the template file, the Application Generator stores a list of all the information you must provide 
each procedure. It also determines the points at which you can embed your own Clarion source code to customize a 
procedure. The registry file contains the default windows, dialogs, menus, report designs, default data, and formulas. In 
the design process, you customize these defaults. 
2. At code generation time, the Application Generator evaluates the information you provide in the design process--
from the data dictionary, and the .APP file--then processes it along with the template language statements and 
symbols in the TemplateRegistry.TRF file to generate your source code. 
Each template can contain multiple types of procedure templates from which you select to create the procedures in your 
application. Before you can use a template it must be in the Template Registry. 
You can see which template registry file you are editing by hovering the mouse over the Template Registry tab 
The Template Registry dialog provides toolbar buttons for file maintenance options for the registry: 
 
The Register, Unregister, Enable, and Disable buttons are not available in Multi-Developer mode. To change this setting, 
select Tools Application Options.  
Save and Close 
 
Saves the current registry changes and closes the registry 
Cancel 
 
Closes the Template Registry dialog window without saving the 
current changes. 
Save 
 
Saves the current registry changes without closing. 
Register 
 
Calls the Open File dialog, which allows you to register a template 
(.TPL) file. 
 
If you encounter any error during the registration process, use the IDE 
Outpad Pad to view and correct any template errors. 
Unregister 
 
This button deletes the currently highlighted template class from 
TemplateRegistry.TRF.

Edit Definition 
 
This button displays the Template code (the .TPL or .TPW) in the 
Template Editor. You may edit the code in this window. If the currently 
highlighted item in the Template Registry tree is a module, the text 
window opens to the first line of the MODULE definition. If a 
procedure, it opens to the first line of the PROCEDURE. If the 
highlighted template is one of several in a single file, it opens to the 
first line of the highlighted template. 
Enable 
 
This button enables the currently highlighted template class or 
procedure (if you had previously disabled it). 
Disable 
 
This button disables the currently highlighted template class or 
procedure, which makes it unavailable to your application. 
Expand All 
 
This button expands all template classes to reveal all template 
sections for each template class registered. 
Contract All 
 
This button contracts all template classes to Class definitions only. 
Useful when there are a large number of template classes registered. 
Help (F1 Key)

Tools Options - Load/Save 
  
The Load/Save options control how all documents are handled in the IDE. Documents are listed in the Start Page Source 
Files link, and in the File > Recent Files IDE menu item. 
As you create a new document, the path is specified as you save the document for the first time. 
Load user-specific settings with the document 
When this option is active, your user-defined settings, stored in the Documents and Settings Application Data section, will 
be applied. If this setting is off, the IDE’s internal defaults are used. 
Detect external changes to files 
This option displays a dialog to reload a document when changes have been detected from an external source (i.e., an 
external editor). 
Auto-load changes if saved 
Specify to reload a document if changes in the document have been detected. 
Always create backup copy 
Check this option to automatically create a backup copy of all documents.

Tools Options - Projects and Solutions 
  
The options in this dialog control the default location and error options of new Clarion Win32 and Clarion# projects and 
solutions created. 
Settings 
Use Directory of Last Selected Directory as Default Project Location 
When checked, the last directory accessed by the IDE will override the Default project location.  
Default project location 
Specify the default directory for all new projects created. 
Use solution folder as default when adding a new project to the solution 
Check to maintain the current solution folder as you add new projects.  
Load previous solution on startup 
Check to auto-load the last project/solution that you were working on in the IDE as you restart the IDE in a new session. 
Close Start Page when loading a solution 
Check to automatically close the Start Page anytime a solution is loaded. 
Build and Run options 
The Clarion IDE supports Builds on a separate thread or a separate process. By default, the IDE Builds on a separate 
process. On multi-CPU or multi-core CPU machines this will normally improve the performance of the system as the Build 
action will normally execute on a different CPU that is different to the one the IDE is using. However, due to the added 
overhead of interprocess communication, it may be that on some machines it is better to run the Build as a separate 
thread within the IDE. To disable the Build activity in a separate process, uncheck the Run build as a separate 
process(es) rather than as a thread check box. 
Check the Show error list pad if build finishes with errors to show the Error list by default on a Build error. If 
unchecked, the Output window will display instead with a more verbose error listing. 
Output Details 
Select the type of messaging output that you want during the Build process. The following options are currently available: 
Quiet 
Only display "Build started.", "Build finished successfully." messages, plus errors 
and warnings. 
Minimal 
Same as Quiet 
Normal 
Same as Quiet, plus messages indicating which source files are being compiled.

Tools Options - File Format Associations 
  
This dialog contains a comprehensive list of all file types registered in the IDE. Several file types are enabled (checked) 
and associated with Clarion by default. 
File Associations simply trigger the Windows O/S to recognize certain file formats and associate them with the Clarion 
IDE. Uncheck certain files if you want to associate them with another program. 
 
Coding - Code Generation 
This option should not be confused with the built-in code generation options of Clarion Win32 and Clarion# 
The Code Generation options here refer to the base SharpDevelop support for C#. 
Given an interface that you want to implement, it can be a bit tedious to write all the class methods just to get your 
code to compile, especially if the interface has a large number of methods. SharpDevelop can save you time by 
generating code for you. 
The following link has some additional help regarding this feature: 
http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2006/07/05/FeatureTourCodeGeneration.aspx  
 
Tools Options: Coding - Code Snippets 
Code snippets in this IDE area are very similar to standard editor macros. The "snippets" defined here can easily be 
applied in any file matching the group extension. 
Code snippets are applied using the following syntax: 
code snippet + <SPACE> 
Code snippet is the name defined in the Snippet entry. 
In the Text Editor, press CTRL + J to pop up a list of defined code snippets. You can select any item in the pop up list, 
and press the <ENTER> key to apply it. 
Code snippets defined are case sensitive. In addition, the file extensions defined in the group are also case sensitive. For 
example, add .CLW;.Clw;.clw in order to be sure that you could pop up a Code Snippets regardless of the case of the 
Extension on the file that you are editing.

Tools Options: Coding - Edit Standard Headers 
Standard Headers are textual information that loads by default when new files are created. 
Standard headers for C#, VBNET, C++.NET and of course, Clarion, are listed here. 
  
This is the default header for new Clarion (CLW) files: 
  
## OMIT('***')
* Created by Clarion Win32.0. 
* User: ${USER} 
* Date: ${DATE} 
* Time: ${TIME} 
*  
* To change this template use Tools | Options | Coding | Edit Standard Headers. 
*** 
  
At press time, here is the complete list of "User defined" IDE elements that you can use in the header: 
  
## "USER", "DATE", "TIME", "ITEMPATH", "ITEMDIR", "ITEMFILENAME", "ITEMEXT", "CURLINE", "CURCOL",
## "CURTEXT", "TARGETPATH", "TARGETDIR", "TARGETNAME", "TARGETEXT","PROJECTDIR",
## "PROJECTFILENAME", "COMBINEDIR", "COMBINEFILENAME", "STARTUPPATH"
  
Each element should be prepended with a $ character, and surrounded by curly braces "{ }".

Component Inspector 
  
The options in this section affect the Component Inspector tool, which is found in the IDE Tools menu. 
This tool is used to explore and search classes and types from any .NET assembly or COM component. You can also: 
Trace events on any object.  
Create any object from an assembly.  
Create controls on the design surface, move, resize or embed them in other Controls;  
Search for types or object content.  
Examine or alter any field or property in the created objects.  
Execute any method on the created objects  
Execute an application, class, or control without writing any code.  
More information can be found at the following link: 
http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2006/06/20/UsingTheComponentInspector.aspx  
and also: 
http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2006/05/21/ComponentInspector.aspx  
 
Component Inspector - Object Tree 
The Object Tree options affect how data is displayed in the Component Inspector’s Object tab, allowing you to show or 
hide properties, methods, events for the objects on display. 
Show Members 
In the object tree, check the members that you wish to display in the object tree. You have Fields, Properties, Methods 
and Events as the available choices. 
Show 
This group controls the level of information that is displayed in the object tree.  
Categories 
The Show member categories option will group all events together under an Events parent node in the Objects panel. 
Properties, methods and fields are also grouped together under their own parent group node. 
The Show base class categories option will group all events, methods, fields and properties under a single parent node. 
You can also specify whether both the above groupings, base class categories and member categories, will only occur if 
the total number of members exceeds a specified threshold. 
The Show Object members in base category option determines whether the members of the standard base classes, 
System.Object, System.__ComObject and System.MarshalByRefObject are always shown for an object in the Objects 
view. 
Component Inspector - Type Handler 
The Component Inspector has its own special handlers for IEnumerator, IList and EventHandlerList types that display 
the contained objects in a more user friendly way. The Type Handler options panel allows you to enable or disable the 
special handling of these types.

Text Editor Options 
To personalize your editing environment, customize the appearance, cursor behavior and other items use the Text Editor 
Options dialog. 
To view the dialog, choose Tools Options. From the main IDE menu. Select the Text Editor tree item, which reveals the 
following set of sub-options. 
  
General 
  
Enable doublebuffering 
On some machine configurations, the drawing of multi-colored text and other items can sometime cause flicker, due to the 
multiple passes that must be performed. Check this box to enable double buffering, which draws each line of text into an 
off-screen buffer before displaying it visually. This can have an effect of slower loading in some older machines, but 
doublebuffering in most cases is recommended. 
Enable folding 
Check this box to enable the folding of all data and code structures. This feature is handy for consolidating complex code 
sections, but also has a disadvantage of losing readability with more complex nested structures. Folding in most cases is 
recommended. 
Show Quick ClassBrowser Panel 
Check this box to display a special panel that allows you to quickly jump to selected areas of the text file. 
  
 
  
The drop list on the left lists all data structures, like files and queues. The drop list on the right stores class structures used 
in this text file 
Font 
The Font settings allow you to control the appearance of text displayed in the Text Editor. A sample window is provided to 
view the font and other options that you have selected.

Markers and Rulers 
  
The Markers and Rulers section controls the majority of the Text Editor’s visual elements: 
Show Horizontal Ruler 
This option places a ruler at the top of the Editor window. 
Show column ruler 
Places a vertical line marker at whatever column you specify. 
Line Marker Style 
This option controls how your active line is displayed. Select Full Row for a special color indicator on the entire line. 
Show line numbers 
Activate this option to show line numbers on the left side of the editor window. 
Underline errors 
Activating this option will trigger an underlining of any errors produced by the compiler. 
Highlight matching bracket 
This option locates and highlights matching brackets whenever any bracket is active. This option is valid for ( ) [ ] { } 
Show invalid lines 
Activate this option to show invalid lines detected by the type of configuration that you have loaded. Using the "Clarion" 
highlighting scheme (the default), no lines are considered invalid. 
Show EOL markers 
Activate this option to show the "end of line" markers. These markers are identified by the special paragraph mark "¶" 
Show spaces 
Activate this option to show space markers. These markers are identified by standard "dot" markers. 
Show tabs 
Activate this option to show tab markers. These markers are identified by the special " » " character. 
 
Behavior 
The Behavior dialog window controls a wide spectrum of options that greatly affects your productivity in the Text editor. 
Tab size 
Enter the tab size in character size increments. Pressing the TAB key moves the caret (the place where something is to 
be inserted in a line) the specified number of characters. 
Indentation size 
Enter the indentation length in character size increments. Pressing the ENTER key indents the caret the specified number 
of characters. 
Indentation (CTRL + I) 
indentation functionality is divided into 2 essential parts: 
• 
Indentation of the existing text (Ctrl + I) or formatting after pressing the Enter key. 
• 
Cursor positioning on a new line. 
There are three modes of indentation available in the Text Editor: 
None 
Set this to turn off all indentation effects. Existing text is not indented neither automatically nor by the CTRL+I hot key. 
Cursor is always placed to the first column on a new line. 


---

IDE Reference 
44 
Automatic 
With Indentation set to Automatic ,the Text Editor keeps a running indent. When you press the Enter key, spaces and 
tabs are inserted to line up the insert point under the start of the previous line. In this mode indentation is set to the 
same value as on the previous line. For example, if the text on the previous line starts from the column 8, indented 
existing text will start from the column 8 (or the cursor on a new line will be placed to the column 8). If you try to indent 
the entire text in the document (CTRL+A, CTRL+I), all lines will start from column 1. 
Smart 
After a keyword statement, the next line is indented by the tab size set (see above). After certain keywords (break, 
return etc.) the next line is "non-indented". 
Other rules for Smart include 
• 
The Preferred column number (found in the Clarion Specific Options section) identifies a column where a 
keyword will be placed if it is not located already in some code block. In other words, if the keyword should not be 
indented relative to the parent it will be placed in the preferred column. The default value is column 21. 
• 
Statements are indented from the CODE keyword position (default = on). CODE, DATA and INCLUDE (and 
USING and INLINE in Clarion#) keywords have one indent. 
• 
END is indented to the same column as a keyword in the line that opens a code block: 
• 
Keywords inside a code block have one indent from a parent keyword. For example, in the pp PROCEDURE: 
 
• 
If a procedure inside a MAP (MODULE) is written without the PROCEDURE keyword, it will be indented: 
 
• 
Any expression that ends with a colon ":" is treated as a label in the CODE section (default = off, where colons are 
treated as an actual procedure call) 
• 
A line is indented after the Enter key is pressed at the end of the line (The default is on). 
• 
You can automatically indent several lines of pasted text (The default is off). 
• 
Source comments may also be indented (The default is off). 
• 
If previous line has line continuation character '|' the next line will have one indent from the previous one. 
• 
In the code definition section (prior to the CODE statement) the cursor is placed on column 1 on a new line. In the 
CODE section, the cursor is indented according to written statements.

Finally, if you are transferring code from another developer, and there are different Tab Size or Convert Tabs to 
Spaces options or the code is formatted manually, you may see the erratic behavior when using Smart indentation 
mode. This is due to the line(s) formatted according to your settings but all other lines remaining unchanged. To solve 
this issue you have several options: 
1) Use the same tab size and indentation mode settings as the other developer. 
2) Reformat the code before changing it (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I). 
3) Uncheck the Enable entered line formatting option so that the line will not be reformatted after pressing the Enter 
key. 
4) Change indentation mode to None or Automatic. 
See the Clarion Specific options dialog to control the options described above. 
Convert Tabs to Spaces 
When this option is active, all tab characters are auto converted to space characters when the document is opened. 
Can move caret behind EOL 
Checking this option allows you to move the caret marker beyond the EOL marker. 
Automatic template insertion 
This feature is not applicable to Clarion Win32 at this time. 
Auto insert curly braces 
This feature is not applicable to Clarion Win32 at this time. 
Hide mouse cursor while typing 
Check this option to hide the mouse cursor while typing. The mouse cursor will reappear when the mouse is subsequently 
moved. 
Cut or Copy entire line when nothing is selected. 
Activating (checking) this option will automatically move the entire line to the clipboard during any Cut or Copy action. 
Mousewheel direction 
This option is used to set the default scrolling direction of the mouse wheel.

Identifies the preferred column position of indentation, if the line to be indented is not based on a Parent keyword (e.g., 
CODE, IF, CASE, etc.). 
Enable entered line formatting 
Indents a line after the Enter key is pressed at the end of the line. 
Indent statements from CODE 
Allows indentation to be positioned relative to the location of the CODE statement. 
Treat statement ends with colon as label 
This option tells the editor to treat expressions that ends with a colon ( : ) as a statement label in the CODE section. If this 
option is off, expressions ending with a colon are treated as a procedure call. You need to have the caret position at the 
beginning of the target statement, and then press Enter. With option on, statement is moved to column one on the next 
line. With this option off, the statement is indented. 
Indent comments 
Indicates that any commented text will be treated as other non-commented text based on the current settings. For 
example, if the "pasting" option is active below, comments will be indented when pasting. If this option is off, comments 
will not be indented when pasting. 
Format text after pasting several lines 
Auto format (e.g., indent according to your settings) pasted text if several lines are pasted.

Code Completion 
Clarion provides code completion as you type helping you to quickly find and enter an object's method, property or event. 
Typing the dot character "." after an object's name will automatically bring up a list of possible methods, properties and 
events that are available for that object. 
 
Typing the first few characters of the method, property or event will select the matching list item. Pressing the Tab key will 
complete the code by inserting the currently selected list item into the source code. 
 
You can toggle the Code Completion feature here, on the IDE Edit Menu, IDE toolbar, or by hot key. 
In addition, after certain keywords (like NEW and USING), pressing CTRL + SPACE will also display the code completion 
drop list. Enter ALT + RightArrow to see only the identifiers that start with typed expression. 
Enable Code Completion 
Check this box to activate the code completion feature.

Pre-select recently used members 
Check this box to allocate a memory cache of recently used items. This will allow for quicker parsing in large projects. Set 
the number of items in the Save option, and press the Clear Cache button to remove all items from memory. 
Show tooltip when moving mouse over expression 
Check this box to activate the assisted tooltip when moving your mouse over any valid expression. Check the  Only in 
debug mode box to only enable in Debug mode. 
Narrow down completion list on typing 
This option causes the typed word to act as a filtered locator for the code completion list. 
Add new line after enter in case of fully typed word 
If you press the ENTER key, and the word selected in the completion list equals the word in the typed text, a new line will 
be inserted. Otherwise, if the option is disabled, the ENTER key just closes the completion list. 
Complete word after 'insertion key' (space, dot, bracket, etc.) 
If enabled and you press a dot after partially typed word, the word will be completed. For example, you type "sys" and a 
"System" is selected in the completion list, after pressing a dot you will have "System.". If the option is disabled, you will 
have "sys.". "Insertion key" is actually any character except letters, digits and underscore (and colon in Clarion). 
Language Dependant Options 
Show completion list after a character is typed 
When active, the code completion window is automatically displayed as you type in any character that does not exist on 
column one (1). 
Trigger code completion after keywords 
Shows code completion after some of the language keywords. For example, in C# after you press SPACE after the "new", 
"as", "is", "override", etc. keywords, you will see the code completion window with suggestions (this works also if you enter 
an opening "(" after some keywords, like "for", "foreach", etc.). In Clarion/Clarion# there is only one keyword (DO) that 
triggers a completion list, and this displays a list of routines that can be called. 
Show tooltip when writing method calls 
When active, as the parameters of any method call is entered (by opening parenthesis), a tool tip pops up that offers the 
possible method parameters, if applicable. When this is active, you also have the option to Re-open tooltip with better 
overload when pressing comma. This checkbox reopens the tooltip with a more restricted set of choices, based on the 
parameters already entered. If the method is overloaded you will see all variants in the tooltip. But if you start writing the 
arguments of the method call, the number of possible variants is reduced so at the next comma the tooltip should be 
updated to show only overloads that receive typed arguments. This functionality should work in C# projects but at this 
time is not supported in Clarion.

NCover is the open source code coverage tool for .NET.  
NCover provides statistics about your code, telling you how many times each line of code was executed during a 
particular run of the application. The most common use of code coverage analysis is to provide a measurement of how 
thoroughly your unit tests exercise your code. After running your unit tests under NCover, you can easily pinpoint sections 
of code that are poorly covered and write unit tests for those portions. Code coverage measurement is a vital part of a 
healthy build environment.

Windows Forms Designer - General 
  
The Windows Forms Designer is used in designing .NET applications. Select form the following options: 
Use Smart Tags 
Smart Tags are shortcuts for certain properties and events. For example, given a List Box control, selecting the "Edit 
items" tag is much the same to press the ellipsis (...) button on property "Items". The "Edit items" tag is the Smart Tag. 
Enable in-place editing of ToolStrips 
Toolstrips are special controls are toolbars that can host menus, controls, and user controls in your Windows Forms 
applications 
Automatically open Smart Tags 
The Windows Forms designer allows developers to perform common tasks and edit common properties directly from the 
design surface. 
When a control is selected or when the mouse hovers over a control’s surface, a smart tag anchor is shown. Clicking this 
opens a panel containing common control properties and tasks that developers can perform without writing a single line of 
code. The smart tag allows the creation and selection of a data source without leaving the designer. 
Use optimized code generation 
Optimizing code generation can result in a more efficient link, but may disable some debugger features. 
Insert "TODO" comment in new event handlers 
An event handler is a procedure in your code that determines what actions are performed when an event occurs, such as 
when the user clicks a button or a message queue receives a message. When an event is raised, the event handler or 
handlers that receive the event are executed. Events can be assigned to multiple handlers, and the methods that handle 
particular events can be changed dynamically. This option places a "TODO" comment in event handlers that have not be 
created yet. 
Activate the designer after file opening 
When this setting is on, the Windows Forms Designer will automatically open a valid source file into the Designer from the 
Properties Pad. This is similar to clicking on the Design tab. This option should be turned off for larger projects in order to 
increase the initial project load time. 
Sort properties alphabetically 
Check this option to sort the properties dialog alphabetically by default.

Windows Forms Designer - Grid Options 
  
The Clarion Win32 Structure Designer offers two ways to position and align your controls, using either Lines or the Grid. 
Snap to Grid 
Determines whether the Window Designer will snap the controls to the grid. The resizing and movement of controls on the 
designer are constrained to the Grid Width and Grid Height when this feature is turned on. Having Snap to Grid turned 
on makes it easier to line up the various aspects of the user interface precisely, but limits the freedom with which one can 
place controls.  
Snap Lines 
Aligning controls relative to each other in a form has always been a challenge. Snap lines are a new feature that give you 
visual suggestions to help you more easily place and size controls relative to each other. Snap lines appear when controls 
are dragged from the Toolbox or moved around the Window designer area. The advantage of snap lines is that you are 
given guidance on not only alignment, but also proximity. Not only can you line up the bottom border of a Prompt and 
Entry control, but you can also manage the distance between them to create a consistent aesthetically pleasing look. 
Grid Width 
Enter the horizontal distance between the grid dots (x axis). This is the minimum horizontal distance you can move a 
control when grid snap is on. 
Grid Height 
Enter the vertical distance between the grid dots (y axis). This is the minimum vertical distance you can move a control 
when grid snap is on. 
Show Grid 
Check this box to automatically display the grid in the Designer work area. 
Snap to Grid 
Check this box to turn grid snap on; uncheck it to turn it off. Grid snap displays a dot grid of valid positioning coordinates 
and forces the upper left corner of new controls to align with the dot grid. The end user does not see the grid at run time; it 
is a design tool only.

Check this box to automatically enable the Smart Tags on open. If a control is selected, checking this will display the 
Smart Tags popup menu as the control is selected. 
Enable SuppressTransparency by default 
Check this box to enable the design time SuppressTransparency property. The effect of this property is to allow the 
proper display of special static parent controls when populated "on top of" multiple tab controls. This property is set to 
TRUE by default, and ensures a proper display regardless of Visual Styles used. It has no effect on the actual runtime 
window display. 
Enable UseVisualStyles by default 
Use this option to control the display of Visual Styles for all valid controls in design mode (controls appear as if the XP 
manifest was active). 
Select Toolbox when Designer opened 
Check this box to automatically open (if not already opened) and select the Windows Control Toolbox when the Window 
Designer is opened. 
Ask on Closing Designer 
This option when checked will ALWAYS prompt you to save a window on exit, even if no changes were made. If this 
option is unchecked, a window will always auto-save on exit, and you will not be prompted to Save or Cancel. 
  
Property pad settings: 
Sort properties alphabetically 
Check this option to sort all properties display in the Properties window in alphabetical order. The alternative to this is a

The options in this dialog control the versions of Clarion that the IDE will register and recognize in the project system. 
Use this dialog to verify versions, roots and redirection paths. The versions that you specify here will be available directly 
in the IDE Project Options. 
Versions are detected by the IDE by reading the install entries in the Windows Initialization file (WIN.INI). If for any reason 
a version you have installed is not detected, you can manually add it here. You can also remove any version that you do 
not need to use in the IDE.

Redirection File 
In Clarion Win32 the redirection system now allows you to include other redirection files using the {INCLUDE} directive. 
This makes it much easier to use local redirection files to specify special paths for an application. 
Clarion Win32 also allows you to use older versions of Clarion to build your project. By default when you use an older 
version of Clarion, the INCLUDE directive is disabled. This is to maintain compatibility with the older redirection files. 
In the Tools/Options/Clarion/Clarion for Windows/Versions dialog, if you select an older version of Clarion and go to the 
Redirection File tab you will see that the Can use the {include} directive is not enabled. If you enable this and change the 
name of the redirection file you can use the new include directive and not break the redirection files if you need to use the 
older IDE. 
After changing the redirection name you will need to create a newname.red file in the bin directory of that version of 
Clarion with the line 
{include %REDDIR%\oldname.red } 
For example, if you change your Clarion 6 Enterprise Edition redirection file from C60EE.RED to C600EE.C7.RED then 
you will need to create in your Clarion 6 bin directory a file named C600EE.C7.RED with the line: 
{include %REDDIR%\c60ee.red } 
Then you can create local redirection files by right clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Create 
Redirection File in the project directory" allowing you to use the power of the Clarion Win32 redirection system without 
stopping you using the older IDE. 
 
Edit Macro Dialog 
Macros are used to add or substitute a custom path for a default template or macro name. 
  
Template (Macro) 
Enter the redirection macro or template name that will be used in the redirection file. 
Example: 
## %ROOT%
Enter the name only here. In the redirection file the %<template>% syntax is used. 
  
Description (Value) 
Enter the valid path to substitute into the macro.

General 
Initial Version Text 
Sets the text to display to set the version of the dictionary. When 
you first create a dictionary it has an initial version with a name 
equal to what you set in that field. During the lifetime of the 
dictionary you can create new versions. Each version is a marker 
that is used in the Audit details of an object. If you go to the Audit 
tab of any object in the dictionary you will see a Version against 
the Created and Modified details. This indicates which version of 
the dictionary the object was created in and in with version it was 
last changed.

Dictionary when a new 
version is created 
  
Check this option to automatically add a comment to the

Load Conversion Project 
After a conversion program is generated this option sets how you 
can load the project. You can set this to always load the project, 
never load the project or ask each time a conversion program is 
generated. The default is to ask. 
  
Enforce Clarion# name

By default this is on (checked). When checked, the dictionary 
editor will not allow you to create labels that are not valid in 
Clarion#. For example. AS is an illegal label, but legal in Clarion 
for Windows. If you do not want to worry about Clarion# 
restrictions you can uncheck this box. 
  
If Clarion# restrictions are enabled and you load a dictionary into 
the editor that has a label that violates the Clarion# naming 
restrictions the editor will automatically rename the object to 
ObjectType_OldLabel, where ObjectType is a Table, Alias, 
Global, Pool, Key or Column. If the object is a Key or a Column

Behavior 
Double-Click toggles Expand/Collapse state 
If set to ON, a dbl-click on any Table toggles the Expand or Collapse state of the Keys and Fields nodes. This can be 
useful when you have all tables collapsed and you want to quickly expand a particular table. 
Rearrange Tables when Expanding or Collapsing 
When you toggle the Expand or Collapse state of tables, the default behavior of the Diagrammer will rearrange the layout 
to either move tables further apart to prevent tables overlaying one another (if Expanding), or move the tables closer 
together to reduce excess whitespace (if Collapsing). If you already have your tables arranged exactly how you want 
them, you can set this checkbox to OFF (unchecked), and the tables will not be rearranged. 
 
Printing 
Print Diagram Background Color 
Check this box to print the diagram background color 
Print Diagram Background Image 
Check this box to print the diagram’s background image. 
Print Table Fill Color 
Check this box to allow the printing of the table background color. Otherwise, table colors will not be printed. 
 
Application General Options 
The options in this panel refer to settings in the IDE that affect all applications in regards to the project system. For options 
specific to the application internals see the Application Options topic. 
  
Open application for Edit after Solution is loaded 
Check this box to auto-open the Application Editor when a solution containing an application is detected. If a solution has 
multiple applications, this option is ignored. 
  
Automatically add referenced Applications (.APP) to the Solution 
Determines if dependent applications are automatically added to the solution during the conversion process. If set to OFF 
(unchecked), then after an application that has dependencies is opened for conversion, a dialog is displayed so you can 
decide if dependent applications should be added to the solution. 
  
Cache application after edit 
For more efficient handling of memory resources, uncheck this box to prevent the automatic caching (lazy loading) of your 
applications. Disabling this option is very useful and recommended for solutions with multiple applications. 
 
If this option is ON, your application on close is still in memory and the associated dictionary is marked is read-only. You 
must close the solution to make the dictionary available for editing. 
If this option is OFF then the dictionary is immediately available for editing when the application is closed.

Redistribute 
Procedures 
Lets you change the number of procedures per module. Specify the 
new number in the Select Procedures per Module dialog. The 
Application Generator then redistributes the procedures among the 
modules, according to the new procedures per module number. 
Repopulate Modules 
Lets you change the number of procedures per module, but still 
keep related procedures together in the same module. Specify the 
new number in the Select Procedures per Module dialog. The 
Application Generator then redistributes the procedures among the 
modules, according to the new procedures per module number. 
Your application may execute slightly faster if you group procedures 
which commonly execute together in the same module 
Renumber Modules 
Renumbers the modules created by the Application Generator. This 
is useful for large projects from which modules have been deleted. 
Delete Empty Modules 
Removes empty generated source code modules from the project. 
This is useful for large projects from which procedures have been 
deleted. 
Delete Empty Libraries 
Removes empty external source code modules, .LIB files, and .OBJ 
files from the project. This is useful for large projects from which 
procedures have been deleted. 
The Delete Modules and Delete Libraries commands do not delete 
disk files, they simply remove any reference to the files from your 
application (.app) and project (.prj) files. 
  
  
New Procedure 
Adds a procedure not connected to the procedure tree. 
Delete Procedure 
Deletes the selected procedure, leaving it as a ToDo item in your 
Application Tree. To remove it completely, remove the reference or 
statement that calls the procedure. 
Copy Procedure 
Copies the selected procedure to a new procedure, which you 
name. 
Synchronize Procedure 
with the Dictionary 
Applies the control attributes specified in the Data Dictionary to all 
the controls in the selected procedure. The attributes are applied as 
specified in the Synchronization tab of the Application Options 
dialog.

The source is as last generated. Any changes made directly to the 
generated source code are overwritten by subsequent source code 
generation. 
 
When you right-click on any procedure and select Module from the pop 
up menu, the Editor stores certain information about the files you open to 
edit. This is a productivity aid; it remembers the line number you were 
last at, and so if a file is opened, positioned to a certain line number, 
closed, then reopened, you are now back at the line where you were last 
positioned. 
  
Source 
Opens the Embeditor which lets you embed your own source code within 
the context of the surrounding generated code.

Application Options Dialog 
(Located in the IDE Tools Menu) 
 
 
Click on a TAB above to see its help 
  
The Application Options dialog allows you to specify default settings for each new application you create. 
Application 
Require Dictionary 
This option specifies that each new application must have 
a data dictionary. 
Default Dictionary 
Names a data dictionary file as the default which appears in 
each new Application Properties Dialog . You can change 
to another dictionary before closing the dialog. 
Display Repeated 
Functions 
Check this box to have the Application Generator 
(Procedure tab only) provide full expansion of procedures 
called from more than one place in the Application Tree. 
Clear the box to provide full expansion of only the first 
instance--every other instance is marked "Expanded 
Above." 
Procedures per Module 
The Procedures per Module spin control specifies the 
number of procedures that the Application Generator 
writes to each source code module. This can affect 
compile time when used with Conditional Generation 
turned on. Specifying one procedure per module, for 
example, means that each successive compile rebuilds 
only those procedures changed since the last one, and no 
more. The down side to this is that it requires more disk 
space. When using the ABC templates, we recommend 
10-20 procedures per module. 
Application Wizard 
Check this box to specify the default when creating a new 
application is to use the Application Wizard. You can 
override this choice when creating an application by 
checking or unchecking the Application Wizard box in the 
Application Properties dialog. 
Procedure Wizards 
Check this box to specify the default when creating a new 
procedure is to use the appropriate Procedure Wizard. 
You can override this choice when creating a procedure 
by checking or unchecking the Procedure Wizard box in 
the Select Procedure Type dialog. 
Open Dictionary Files and 
Template Registry as 
Read-Only 
Specifies file management options for multiple developer 
projects. When checked, Dictionary files and the registry 
are opened read-only.

IDE Reference 
73 
Translate controls to 
control templates when 
populating 
Check this box to have the Window Designer prompt you 
with a list of appropriate control templates whenever you 
place a control. We recommend this setting for new 
Clarion users. 
Import name clash action 
Specifies how the Application Generator handles 
procedure names from an imported application file that 
clash with procedure names already resident. Choose 
from the following: 
Query on first clash 
When the first clash is encountered, the Application 
Generator prompts for specific instructions on how to 
handle this clash and each subsequent clash. Choose 
from Auto Rename, Replace All, or Prompt. 
Auto Rename 
Renames all imported procedures with name clashes by 
appending a sequence number to the imported procedure 
name. 
Replace All 
Replaces all resident procedures with imported 
procedures of the same name. 
Prompt 
Asks for specific instructions for each clash encountered. 
Choose from Replace or Rename. 
Replace 
Replaces the resident procedure with the imported 
procedure of the same name. 
Rename 
Prompts you to rename the imported procedure. 
  
  
  
Ask for alternative 
For all procedures with the same name, the Application Generator 
prompts you to rename each imported procedure. 
Auto Rename 
For all procedures with the same name, the Application Generator 
renames the imported procedure by appending a sequence number to 
the name. 
Replace previous 
For all procedures with the same name, the Application Generator 
replaces the resident procedures with the imported procedures. 
  
Disable Column 
Prompts 
Specifies that template-generated field-specific prompts will not display. 
This does not disable prompts created by Control Templates. 
Sort Embeds 
Alphabetically 
Check this box to show embed points in alphabetical order in the 
Embedded Source dialog. Clear the box to show the embed points in 
"logical" order (order of execution). See Embedded Source Code for more 
information.

IDE Reference 
74 
Action for Legacy 
embeds 
Specify how the Application Generator handles legacy embed points. 
Legacy embed points are generally provided for backward compatibility 
among template chains. They allow newer template chains to conditionally 
support embed points from older template chains. See LEGACY in the 
Template Guide. Choose from: 
Ignore all 
Application Generator neither displays Legacy embed points at design 
time nor generates any code embedded therein. We recommend this 
setting to reduce "clutter" when developing new applications. 
Show all and 
generate 
Application Generator displays all Legacy embed points at design time 
and generates any code embedded therein. We generally do not 
recommend this setting; however, it can be useful for developers that are 
very comfortable with a particular template chain and its embed points. 
Show filled and 
generate 
Application Generator displays only filled Legacy embed points at design 
time and generates any code embedded therein. We recommend this 
setting for applications ported to a new template chain. 
Edit embedded 
source errors in 
generated code 
Check this box to allow you to edit embedded source errors in the 
generated source code instead of the standard Embeditor. The 
advantage of this is a logical view of all source code as generated. You 
can edit the source error and the application generator will not 
regenerate code until after the Make and Run is completed. This is 
useful during the testing phase of your development for faster 
prototyping. 
Auto-Make 
Applications 
before compile 
Check this box to trigger the Application Generator to generate source 
prior to the Build action if needed. 
Auto start designer 
on pressing the 
Window or Report 
button. 
Check this box to auto-load the target Designer when pressing the 
Window or Report button located on the Procedure Properties window. 
You can still view the Window or Report text by pressing the tabs in the 
Procedure Properties window. Closing the Designer will direct you to the 
appropriate Window or Report tab. 
Move the MASK 
attribute from 
windows to 
controls 
Check this box to allow the application convertor to automatically move 
the WINDOW MASK attribute to target ENTRY controls. If you plan to 
build the application in any version prior to 7, leave this check box blank. 
  
Registry 
Template Language code can be logically split among many files. Clarion uses the files to produce one logical template 
set for creating applications. The Registry Options are mainly for programmers who produce their own template files or 
make modifications to the default templates. 
Re-register When 
changed 
To automatically re-register your templates when the Application 
Generator detects a change, check the Re-register When changed 
box. This defaults to "On."

Update Template 
Chain when edited 
To automatically update the Template files when making a change in 
the Template Registry, check the Update Template Chain when 
edited box. 
Regenerate Deleted 
Templates 
To specify the Application Generator should re-generate the .TPL and 
.TPW files from TemplateRegistry.TRF, should the files be deleted, 
check the Regenerate Deleted Templates box. 
## #APPLICATION
template 
Select the default APPLICATION template from the drop-down list. 
The APPLICATION template controls source code generation. See 
Template Overview in the Template Guide for more information. 
  
Generation 
Conditional Generation This check box specifies that only source code modules changed 
since the last make should be compiled. 
Debug Generation 
Specifies a text file for the Application Generator to log events to, 
and turns logging on and off. In case of a fatal error by the 
Application Generator, this log provides a trace to identify where the 
problem occurred. You can specify the file name in the Debug 
Filename box. 
 
As you load (open) the application, you will see (DEBUG) in the title 
bar of the Open Application message window 
. 
  
Generation Message 
Allows you to specify what displays during generation. Displaying 
messages increases generation time slightly, but offers more 
information on generation progress and more opportunities to 
cancel.  
The choices are: 
  
No Messages 
Displays no messages. 
Module Names 
Displays the Module Name as it generates 
Module and Procedure 
Names 
Displays the Module Name as it generates and the Procedure Name 
as it generates 
All Messages 
Displays the Module Name as it generates, the Procedure Name as 
it generates, and each portion of the procedure as it generates.

Enable #ASSERT 
checking 
Check this box to enforce heightened error checking during source 
code generation. This allows the Application Generator to identify 
certain template execution problems and notify you during source 
code generation. This slows the code generation process slightly. 
Clear the box for faster, but riskier source code generation. See 
#ASSERT for more information. 
Use long file names for 
generated files 
The default generation of application source files is the full 
application name followed by a three digit module number. If you 
would like to use the older 8.2 naming format, uncheck this box. 
Use dot syntax for fields 
of structures 
Used for the Clarion.NET Application Generator to generate field 
qualification syntax for all data structures instead of the older 
prefix:label format. 
Create local maps 
Check this box to generate a MAP structure for each source 
module that prototypes only the procedures referenced in the 
module. This results in faster compiles whenever you add new 
procedures or change procedure prototypes, because only the 
affected modules are recompiled. To generate accurate local 
maps, you must use the Procedures button in the Procedure 
Properties dialog to identify any procedures referenced in 
embedded source code.Clear this box to generate a single MAP 
for the PROGRAM module that prototypes all the program's 
procedures globally. This results in slower compile times whenever 
you add new procedures or change procedure prototypes, 
because the change to the PROGRAM module forces a recompile 
of all application source modules. 
Enable embed 
commenting 
Check this box to optimize automatic comment generation 
specified by the application templates.  
  
Synchronization 
This tab lets you specify how and when control attributes defined in your data dictionary are applied to your application's 
procedures and controls. See Also: How to Synchronize your App and Dictionary . 
Synchronize Application 
when opened 
Check this box to reapply data dictionary attributes each time your 
application is opened. Clear the box to apply the attributes only on 
your explicit command.  
Synchronize Window 
definitions 
Check this box to apply data dictionary attributes to WINDOW 
structures during application-wide synchronization. Clear the box 
to ignore WINDOW structures. 
Synchronize Report 
definitions 
Check this box to apply data dictionary attributes to REPORT 
structures during application-wide synchronization. Clear the box 
to ignore REPORT structures. 
Update controls for 
variables 
Check this box to apply memory variable control attributes to their 
associated controls. Clear the box to ignore controls associated 
with memory variables.

Primary attributes only 
Check this box to apply only the primary control attributes. Primary 
attributes are those attributes set directly in the Column Properties 
dialog. They include Column Name, Characters (length), Screen 
Picture, Prompt Text, Column Heading, Case (UPR, CAP), Typing 
Mode (INS, OVER), Flags (IMM, PASSWORD, READONLY), 
Justification, Initial Value, Help IDs, Messages, Tool Tips, and 
Validity Checks. Secondary attributes are those attributes set by 
pressing the Properties button on the Window and Report tabs of 
the Field Properties dialog. 
 
Check the Primary attributes only box to speed up the 
synchronization process, especially if you synchronize each time 
you open the application. 
Clear HELP, MSG, TIP if 
omitted in dictionary 
Check this box to override control specific help attributes (set from 
the Window Designer) with blank help attributes from the data 
dictionary. Clear the box to retain control specific help attributes 
despite blank help attributes in the dictionary. 
Allow control types to 
change 
Check this box to apply new control types. For example, a SPIN 
may replace an ENTRY. The synchronizer does not change the 
number of controls on a window or report; therefore it does not 
change an OPTION to a LIST or vice versa. However, it does 
issue a warning when it encounters this situation. 
 
Changing a control's type can result in "orphaned" embed code. 
For example a SPIN supports a NewSelection embed point, but 
an ENTRY does not. Orphaned embed code should be manually 
moved to an appropriate place. 
Allow conversion from 
list to drop list 
Check this box to allow a drop list to replace a list.  
Clear all other attributes 
if omitted in dictionary 
Check this box to override all control specific attributes (attributes 
set from the Window Designer) except HELP, TIP, and MSG 
with blank attributes from the dictionary. Clear the box to retain 
control specific attributes despite blank attributes in the dictionary. 
Clearing the box also enables the More button so you can set 
each attribute individually. 
More 
Press this button to elect, for each individual attribute, whether to 
override the control specific (Window Designer) attribute with a 
blank attribute from the dictionary or whether to keep the attribute 
despite a blank attribute in the dictionary. Attributes are Font, 
Alert, Tally, Cursor, Key, Icon, and Colors.

Dictionary can override 
size 
Check this box to let data dictionary size attributes prevail over 
Window Designer size attributes. Control sizes can change when 
the height or width value is default and the control's text changes, 
or when an explicit height or width value in the dictionary varies 
from the control specific (Window Designer) height or width 
values. 
Ignore Freeze attribute 
setting 
Check this box to apply data dictionary attributes to controls with 
the #Freeze attribute. Clear the box to leave frozen controls 
alone. If you synchronize a single control, the synchronizer 
ignores the #Freeze. #Freeze is effective only when you 
synchronize multiple controls, i.e. an entire application or 
procedure, a WINDOW structure such as an OPTION or a 
GROUP, or a REPORT structure such as a DETAIL, BREAK, 
HEADER, or FOOTER. 
Refreeze frozen control 
after synchronize 
Check this box to" refreeze" the control after synchronizing it. 
Clear the box to "unfreeze" the control after synchronizing. 
Update column 
formatting 
Check this box to apply dictionary attributes to LIST FORMAT 
strings (i.e. justification). In other words, format list box columns 
according to data dictionary attributes. Clear this box to leave 
LISTs alone. 
Update column headers 
Select from the drop-down list to specify when List Box column 
headers are applied from the data dictionary. Choose from: 
Always 
The Application Generator always applies the dictionary column 
header, even if it is blank. 
If present in dictionary 
The Application Generator applies the dictionary column header 
only if it is non-blank, otherwise, the LISTs column header 
prevails. 
Window and Dictionary 
The Application Generator applies the dictionary column header 
only if both are non-blank, otherwise, the LISTs column header 
prevails. This lets a blank column header on a LIST prevail over a 
non-blank column header in the data dictionary. 
Never 
The Application Generator never applies the dictionary column 
header. The LIST's column header always prevails. 
Display warning if could 
not synchronize 
Check this box to display a warning dialog if warnings occur 
during synchronization. Warnings occur when controls change 
size, when there is a different number of radio buttons in the 
dictionary than on the window or when an OPTION is replaced 
with a different control (e.g. a drop-down list). 
Add report entry when 
controls change size 
Check this box to generate warnings when controls change size. 
Clear the box to suppress size change warnings.

This dialog allows you to create a new application, or edit the "essential" information for an existing .APP file. 
Application File 
Type a name for the .APP file. When opening the .APP file, the IDE makes 
the directory in which the .APP file resides the working directory. 
Dictionary File 
Type the name of the data dictionary file (.DCT). You can press the ellipsis 
button ( ... ) to locate the dictionary file using the Select Dictionary dialog. 
See How to Create a Data Dictionary for information on creating your 
application's data dictionary. 
Note: The Application Generator does not require a data dictionary to 
generate an application, if you uncheck the Require a dictionary box in the 
Application Options dialog 
  
  
First Procedure 
Type the name of the first procedure. This is usually called MAIN. 
Destination Type 
Select Executable, Library or Dynamic Link Library. 
Help File 
Optionally type the name of a Windows Help file (.HLP). The file must exist 
on disk, but it can be a "dummy" file. You can press the ellipsis button ( ... ) 
to locate the help file using the Open File dialog. 
  
  
Application 
Template 
The template controls code generation. You can select the default Clarion 
or ABC template, or choose a third party template set by pressing the 
ellipsis button ( ... ), then choosing from the Select Application Type 
dialog. 
To Do Template 
Accept the default ToDo(template chain) in the To Do Template field. 
Application 
Wizard  
Check the Application Wizard box to use the wizard to create a complete 
application based on the selected dictionary and a few answers you 
specify. This option is only available when you are creating a new 
application.  
  
Notes: 
1. Create new .APP files only using the Clarion IDE. Do not copy a file (using the DOS command line, or File 
Manager) to a new file name, then open it in Clarion. This prevents the Application Generator from changing the 
internal names recorded in the file. If you need to copy and rename an .APP file, open it, then use the File Save 
As command.  
2. Application file names, besides being legal DOS names, must also be valid Clarion labels. The file name, 
1MyApp.APP, for example, is illegal because it starts with a number instead of a character.

BIND Fields and Procedures 
The process of BIND ing a field, procedure or expression allows the entity be used in an expression string for either the 
EVALUATE procedure or a VIEW structure's FILTER attribute. 
This template interface allows you to specify that a BIND is generated for the fields, procedures, and expressions you 
designate. The template interface generates the proper syntax for each of these entities. 
On the Fields tab, you may insert, change or delete a field to be BINDed by selecting the Developer Defined tab, and 
selecting the appropriate button. You will be presented with an ellipsis that will allow you to select any variable defined 
within your application. The Template Defined tab displays any variables that have already been BINDed by other 
templates. You should always check this tab to verify a list of variables already BINDed. 
On the Procedures tab, you may insert, change or delete a procedure to be BINDed by selecting the Developer Defined 
tab, and selecting the appropriate button. You will be presented with a drop list that will allow you to select any procedure 
name currently defined within your application. You can also add new procedure names not yet defined here. The 
Template Defined tab displays any procedures that have already been BINDed by other templates. You should always 
check this tab to verify a list of procedures already BINDed. 
On the Expressions tab, you may insert, change or delete a name to be BINDed to an expression by selecting the 
appropriate button. 
Name 
Enter a string value to use as the name to be used to identify the BINDed 
expression. 
Expression 
An expression is a mathematical formula containing any valid combination of 
variables, functions, operators, and constants. Enter a valid expression to be 
BINDed. Example: (TODAY() – 1) 
  
Press the "E" button to call the Expression Editor. This dialog is used to help 
you construct syntactically correct expressions to use in the Expression 
prompt.

Click on a TAB to see its help 
This dialog specifies application level options for file processing, .INI file support, plus lets you define global variables. 
General 
Program Author 
Lets you add your own name, which is then added into the .APP file. 
Default Icon 
Press the ellipsis button to select an icon to use as the program icon. You may also specify a variable name here by 
prefacing the variable with an exclamation point (!). The templates implement the use of SYSTEM {PROP:Icon}. 
Use Field Description as MSG() when MSG() is Blank 
Check this box to tell the Application Generator to use field descriptions from the Field Properties dialog as the default 
MSG attribute. 
Generate Template global data and ABC's as EXTERNAL 
Adds the EXTERNAL attribute to the global variable declarations generated by the templates, and the DLL attribute to any 
CLASS declarations generated by the templates. This means your program relies on an external library to allocate 
memory for these variables and objects, and to export them so your program can access them. 
You should add the EXTERNAL and DLL attributes to get the same effect for any global variables or classes you declare. 
See the Language Reference for more information on these attributes. 
 
If you create a program that consists of more than one AppGen created DLL, you should check the Generate Global Data 
as EXTERNAL box for all the applications except one. See the User's Guide--Development and Deployment Strategies. 
External Globals and ABC's Source Module 
Specify whether the external library is dynamically or statically linked. 
This sets the flag parameter of the DLL attribute for template generated class declarations. See the Language Reference 
for more information on the DLL attribute. 
Generate Embed Comments  
Check this box to generate identifying comments surrounding all embedded source code. 
Non Volatile Storage Settings 
The Clarion and ABC Templates non volatile storage support the use of .INI (standard windows initialization) files or the 
system registry. These are mediums that store information for an application between sessions. 
One use for non volatile storage is to store the user’s preferred window positions for the next session. Another use is to 
save program configuration settings between sessions. Clarion’s procedure templates let you do both automatically when 
you enable non volatile storage support.

Seconds for RECOVER  
Specifies the number of seconds to wait before invoking the RECOVER process. This is applicable only to Clarion files.  
  
File Attributes 
Threaded 
Specifies whether the application generator adds the THREAD attribute to FILE structures. THREAD is needed for MDI 
browse and form procedures to prevent record buffer conflicts when the end user changes focus from one thread to 
another. 
Use File Setting 
Sets the THREAD attribute according to the data dictionary.  
All Threaded 
Adds the THREAD attribute to each FILE.  
None Threaded 
Omits the THREAD attribute for each FILE. 
Create 
Specifies whether your application should allow the creation of a data file should it not exist. Adds the CREATE attribute 
to the FILE structure. 
Use File Setting 
Sets the CREATE attribute according to the data dictionary.  
Create All 
Adds the CREATE attribute to each FILE.  
Create None 
Omits the CREATE attribute for each FILE. 
External 
Specifies whether the application generator adds the EXTERNAL attribute to FILE structures. EXTERNAL specifies the 
memory for the FILE's record buffer is allocated by an external library. 
None External 
Omits the EXTERNAL attribute from all file declarations.  
All External 
Adds the EXTERNAL attribute to all file declarations and lets you specify the Declaring Module and whether All files are 
declared in another .APP. 
 
When using EXTERNAL to declare a FILE shared by multiple libraries (.LIBs, or .DLLs and .EXE), only one library should 
define the FILE without the EXTERNAL attribute. This ensures that there is only one record buffer allocated for the FILE 
and all the libraries and the .EXE will reference the same memory when referring to data elements from that FILE. 
Generate File Declarations in Modules 
This checkbox is valid (enabled) when global data and file declarations are local to the application (EXE/DLL target with 
no external files). 
When this check box is on (checked), file declarations are created in separate source files (similar to the ABC 
FileManager methods which are located in "base class" (BC) files). These source files use a FCx.CLW naming convention 
(e.g., myappFC0.CLW - the first five letters of the application name are prepended to the source file name). All file 
declarations in the main module are then declared with the EXTERNAL('') attribute. 


---

IDE Reference 
92 
This option also generates all defined global data in other source files as follows: 
 
myappGLO.CLW stores the global data as it is defined in the main PROGRAM module. 
myappGLF.CLW stores the same global data but with the EXTERNAL attribute added. 
 
where myapp is the first five letters of the application name. 
In the main program module, an INCLUDE for myappGLF.CLW is generated. If any global data is marked as Generate 
Last in the data dictionary, these data elements are defined appropriately in the program’s main module only. 
The default value on how many files are declared in each GLn.CLW module is set by a global template symbol 
%FilesPerFCModule using a default value of 100 files per module. 
 
This option is essential for large applications using more than 500 files, but any application can use this option to better 
organize file and global data declarations. Use the Generate Last option only for variables that require it. 
  
Export all File Declarations 
Checking this box tells the Application Generator to add the file information to the Export file. This is only available when 
the project's Target Type is a DLL and you specify None External (see above). 
Declaring Module 
The filename (without extension) of the MEMBER module containing the FILE definition without the EXTERNAL attribute. 
If the FILE is defined in a PROGRAM module, leave this field blank. 
All files are declared in another .APP 
Checking this box tells the Application Generator that the files are declared in another APP (rather than hand code). 
Application Generator adds the EXTERNAL flag on the File:Open flag (that controls CheckOpen), ensuring that files are 
opened and closed at the right time, thereby preserving the integrity of the file data buffers. 
 
Enable Triggers Support (CLARION Template Chain Only) 
Check this box to enable the Dictionary Triggers support that is part of the ABC Class FileManager. See the topic on 
Dictionary Triggers for more information.

Task Grouping Buttons 
Each task-grouping button identifies tasks or types of tasks the ABC Templates accomplish. Each button lets you specify 
the class or classes the ABC Templates use to accomplish the tasks named by the button's text. Following are the ABC 
Template tasks and their associated default classes. 
General Tasks 
This window allows you to specify the name of the Class that handles certain tasks in your application. You may specify 
alternate classes by typing the class name in the corresponding entry field. The class you name must be an ABC 
compliant class. 
The Configure buttons allow you to set options that affect the behavior of the named class. 
Configure WindowManager 
Reset on gain focus 
Check this box to make the WindowManager unconditionally reset whenever the window receives focus. Clear the box to 
allow a conditional reset (reset only if circumstances demand, for example, when the end user invokes a new BrowseBox 
sort order or invokes a BrowseBox locator).  
Auto Tool Bar 
Check this box to make the WindowManager try to set the appropriate ToolbarTarget whenever the end user selects a 
new TAB control. Clear the box to manually set the ToolbarTarget or use the current ToolbarTarget.

Auto Refresh 
Check this box to make the WindowManager automatically reset the window and its associated objects whenever it 
detects a change. The WindowManager checks for changes after it processes each event. AutoRefresh is particularly 
useful when the resetting of a Browse Box changes a field which is a range-limit of another Browse Box. 
  
Configure ErrorManager 
Default Error Category 
Specify a default error category for errors that do not have their own category. The default is ABC. 
Allow Select & Copy of Message Text 
Check this box to allow your users to highlight, copy and paste message text of posted error to the clipboard for relaying 
the information to the appropriate parties.. 
Store Error History 
Check this box to save error history to be viewed at a later time during the session. 
Limit Stored History 
Check this box to limit the number of history items the history queue can hold at a single instance. 
History Threshold Limit 
Specifies the maximum number of items to hold in history. This is available if Limit Stored History is checked. 
View Trigger level 
Select an error severity level from the drop-down list. When the error level occurs the action is recorded to history. The 
available error levels are Level:Benign, Level:Cancel, Level:Notify, Level:User, Level:Program, and Level:Fatal. 
  
Configure Resizer 
Automatically find parent controls 
Check this box to make each Resizer object set parent/child relationships among window controls. Clearing the box 
makes the WINDOW the parent of all its controls. Setting parent/child relationships lets any special scaling cascade from 
parent to child.  
Optimize Moves 
Check this box to move all controls at once during the resize operation, producing a snappier resize and avoiding bugs on 
some windows.  
Optimize Redraws 
Check this box to make controls transparent (TRN attribute) during the resize operation, producing a smoother redraw 
and avoiding bugs on some windows.  
  
Configure Run-time Translator 
Extract Filename 
Specify a filename to receive a list of all runtime text that may require translation for multi-language applications.  
This is only available if you have checked Enable Run-Time Translation in the Application's Global Properties. 
  
Configure Calendar 
Change Default Color 
Check this box to allow you to ioverride the default colors of the selected CalendarClass. You can change the color for 
Sunday, Saturday, Holiday, and all Other dates. 
Action for Close Button 
Each Calendar Class has a default Select and a default Close button. If you would like both buttons to return the current 
date selected, choose Select and Close from the drop list. If you only want the Select button to return the date, choose 
Cancel from the drop list.

File Management Tasks 
Browser Tasks 
This window allows you to specify the names of the Classes which handles certain tasks in your application’s browsers. 
You may specify alternate classes by typing the class name in the corresponding entry field, or select a class name in the 
drop list provided. The class you name must be an ABC compliant class. 
The Configure button allows you to set options that affect the behavior of the Browser class. Additional browser related 
classes are configured by selecting the appropriate tab control at the bottom of this dialog window. The classes that you 
can configure at the time of this release are EIP (Edit-In-Place), QBE (Query-By Example), Step and Locator Managers, 
and Others (which include Fuzzy, Grid, and Sidebar Managers). 
 
The EIP Configuration has a special Template Interface prompt which controls the level of configuration that you can 
apply to your target browse. Select Original to control EIP behavior with limited template prompt control. Select Detailed 
for more specific control for each column that has EIP enabled. 
For more information concerning these classes, refer to the ABC Library Reference. 
Configure Browser 
Active Invisible 
Check this box to fill the browse queue even when the browse LIST is "invisible" because it is on a non-selected TAB or is 
otherwise hidden. This improves performance for procedures with invisible browse lists; however, buffer contents for the 
invisible browse list should not be relied upon. Clear the box to suppress the refill when the listbox is hidden.  
Allow Unfilled 
Check this box to allow a partially filled LIST when the result set "ends" in mid-list. This improves (SQL) performance by 
suppressing additional reads needed to fill the list. Clear the box to always display a "full" list.  
Retain Row 
Check this box to maintain the highlight bar in the same list row following a change in sort order, an update, or other 
browse refresh action. Clear the box to allow the highlight bar to move.  
Process & Report Tasks 
This window allows you to specify the name of the Class which handles certain tasks in your application. You may specify 
alternate classes by typing the class name in the corresponding entry field. The class you name must be an ABC 
compliant class. 
Ascii Viewer Tasks 
This window allows you to specify the name of the Class which handles certain tasks in your application. You may specify 
alternate classes by typing the class name in the corresponding entry field. The class you name must be an ABC 
compliant class. 
Toolbar Manager Tasks 
This window allows you to specify the name of the Class which handles certain tasks in your application. You may specify 
alternate classes by typing the class name in the corresponding entry field. The class you name must be an ABC 
compliant class. 
ABC Library Files 
This dialog allows the ABC libraries to be linked in to the application, linked in as an external DLL, or linked in as an 
external library. If you choose external DLL or external library, the external library base name must be specified.

Global Classes Window 
Many of the ABC Procedure, Control and Extension templates provide a Classes tab or dialog. These local Classes tabs 
let you control the classes (and objects) your procedure uses to accomplish the template's task—that is, they override the 
global class settings specified here in the Global Properties dialog. Deriving your own class can give you very fine 
control over the procedure when the standard Application Builder Class is not precisely what you need. 
Object Name 
Set the object's label for the template-generated code. 
Use Default Application Builder Class 
Check this box to use the default Application Builder Class. Clear this box to use a class other than the default, and to 
enable the following prompts. 
Use Application Builder Class 
Check this box to select a class from the Base Class drop-down list. The list includes all classes with the LINK attribute in 
\LIBSRC\*.INC files. Clear this box to specify a class declared elsewhere. 
Base Class 
If you checked the Use Application Builder Class? box, select a class from the drop-down list. If you cleared the Use 
Application Builder Class? box, type the class label here, and type the name of the source file that contains the class 
declaration in the Include File entry box. 
Include File 
If you cleared the Use Application Builder Class? box, type the class label in the Base Class entry box, and type the 
name of the source file that contains the class declaration here. 
Derive 
Check this box to derive a class based on the parent class specified above and to enable the New Class Methods and 
New Class Properties buttons to define any new properties and methods for the derived class.  
This prompt is primarily to allow you to define new properties and methods in a derived class. To override existing 
methods, simply embed code in the corresponding method embed points. 
Using Derive?, New Class Methods and New Class Properties makes the template generate code similar to the 
following: 
    MyProcess CLASS(Process) !derive a class from the parent class 
    NewMethod   PROCEDURE    !prototype new class method 
    NewProperty BYTE         !declare new class property 
              END 
 
The template automatically derives from the parent class if you embed code into any of the derived method embed points, 
regardless of the status of this check box.  
New Class Methods 
Press this button to specify the new method prototypes to generate into the derived CLASS structure. This opens the New 
Class Methods dialog (see New Class Methods). 
New Class Properties 
Press this button to specify the new property declarations to generate into the derived CLASS structure. This opens the 
New Class Properties dialog (see New Class Properties).  
Refresh Application Builder Class Information 
Press this button if you have changed the contents of an include file (.INC) or added an include file to the \LIBSRC 
directory. Typically, this is needed when you install third party products that use ABC compliant classes, although you 
may create your own ABC compliant classes too. See ABC Compliant Classes for more information.The ABC Templates 
use information gleaned from the header files for generating embed points, loading the Application Builder Class Viewer, 
application conversion, etc.

List Format Manager Configuration 
The List Format Manager is designed to give you the ultimate control of your Browse Box formatting (display options) to 
your users at runtime. You are essentially creating a table (file) that stores an unlimited amount of list box formatting 
strings, which are read and applied to your target browse box at runtime. Other stored formats are available via a popup 
menu, as well as a Format Editor to define new ones. These options are set on the procedure level, and can be accessed 
here. 
  
 
When using the Listbox Format Manager during development, removal of a column from the list box may result in errors if 
the removed column is still referenced in a previous saved list box format. To avoid this, modify the saved listbox format 
prior to removing any referenced columns from the listbox.  
The list format file can be stored in the active data dictionary, or defined within the specific application. 
The following prompts are provided: 
UserID Field 
Enter a number to assign to all list formats used by this application. You can assign a different number to 
another application, which will only access special formats for that application. 
Press the E button to call the Expression Editor. This dialog is used to help you construct syntactically correct expressions 
to use in the appropriate prompt. 
Table Origin 
Your table that stores the list format information can be created by your Application, or can be a table that is 
defined in your Dictionary. 
We recommend that you allow the Format Manager to create a file for you (Application), and later import it into an existing 
dictionary. This will allow you to share formats between different applications that use the same data dictionary. 
Table Configuration 
If your runtime format file is to be defined in the application (instead of dictionary storage), press this button to access the 
Table Configuration dialog. 
Dictionary Table 
If you have selected Dictionary as the Table Origin choice, press the ellipsis to select the appropriate table 
name from your active dictionary. 
  
The default file format is a TOPSPEED file, and is shown as follows: 
  
LFM_CFile FILE,PRE(CFG),CREATE,DRIVER('TopSpeed'),THREAD,NAME('Formats.FDB') 
key_Main  KEY(+CFG:ProcId,+CFG:UserId,+CFG:CtrlId,+CFG:FormatId),OPT,NOCASE

UserId     SHORT                            ! User identifier 
CtrlId     SHORT                            ! Control identifier 
FormatId   SHORT                            ! Format identifier 
FormatName STRING(30)                       ! Format name 
Flag       BYTE                             ! Default/current flag 
Format     STRING(5120)                     ! Format buffer 
VarLine    STRING(2048)                     ! Variable buffer 
          END 
         END 
  
The file driver that you use from the dictionary may be modified, provided that the field and key labels are not modified.

Some elements of the format file can be modified as shown in the Table Information dialog. 
  
SortOrder’s menu text  
Enter alternate text (or a variable name using !variable format) that the List Format Manager will use to store the menu 
text used in generated "Sort Order" popup item. This allows for translation to alternate languages (e.g., Spanish) if 
needed.

Picture Editor (Edit Picture) 
Some controls let you specify a picture token that provides a special format for display or printing of variables 
There is a great variety and diversity of picture token syntax that depends on the type of data you format: strings, 
numbers, currency, scientific, dates, times, etc. 
The Edit Picture dialog lets you quickly and easily build an appropriate picture token without memorizing picture token 
syntax. Invoke this easy to use dialog by pressing the ellipsis (...) button beside the Picture prompt in the properties 
dialog.

Length 
Specify the length of the string. This length also determines the width of the control if the width is not otherwise specified 
by the control's AT attribute. 
Numeric and Currency 
Numeric and Currency picture tokens specify a length, plus conventional formatting to convey positive and negative 
values, various currencies, etc. 
Size 
The total number of significant digits, plus any formatting characters. For example, $22.25- is 4 significant digits + 3 
formatting characters for a size of 7. 
Decimal Digits 
The number of digits to the right of the decimal. 
Currency 
Choose from None, Leading, and Trailing. None shows no currency symbol. Leading puts the currency symbol to the left 
of the number and Trailing puts the symbol right of the number. 
Symbol 
The currency symbol to display: either a dollar sign ($) or a string constant.  
Negative Sign 
Specify how negative values are formatted. 
Bracket 
Negatives surrounded by parentheses. 
Leading 
Negatives get a leading minus sign. 
Trailing 
Negatives get a trailing minus sign. 
None 
No sign display. 
Decimal Separator 
Specify the character inserted between the integer and fractional portion of the value. 
Period 
Period is the separator. 
Comma 
Comma is the separator. 
None 
Displays no separator. 
Grouping 
Specify the character inserted at every third digit to aid readability. 
Comma 
Comma is the separator. 
Period 
Period is the separator. 
Space 
Space is the separator. 
Hyphen 
Hyphen is the separator. 
Leading Character 
Specify the character to represent leading zeroes.

Clip 
Remove leading zeroes so that any leading format characters abut the left most digit. 
Zero 
Leading zeroes display as zeroes (0). 
Space 
Leading zeroes display as spaces ( ). 
Asterisk 
Leading zeroes display as asterisks (*). 
Blank When Zero 
Check this box to display nothing when the value is zero. 
Scientific 
Scientific Notation picture tokens let you display very large or very small numbers with a decimal format raised by a power 
of ten. The display takes the form -9.99e+999. 
Number of Characters The total number of characters, including the 7 format characters. For 
example, -1.96e+007 requires 10 characters.  
Leading Digits 
The number of digits to the left of the decimal point (typically 1). 
Decimal Separator 
Specify the character inserted at every third digit to aid readability. 
Point 
Period is the separator. 
Comma 
Comma is the separator. 
Space 
Space is the separator.

portion of the value. 
Point 
Period is the separator. 
Comma 
Comma is the separator. 
Blank When Zero 
Check this box to display nothing when the value is zero. 
Date 
Date picture tokens let you display dates in a number of different formats. Choose the format you want from the Format 
drop-down list.  
Better still, date picture tokens in entry fields automatically invoke Clarion's run-time date parsing functions, so you can 
enter '21' and Clarion expands it to the 21st day of the current month and year. Or you can enter 'DEC' and Clarion 
expands it to the 1st day of December of the current year. The date is then formatted according to the picture token. 
 
The MASK attribute (Entry Patterns check box) on a window preempts the date parsing functions. 
Format 
Choose the format you want from the drop-down list. What you see is what you get except for the Windows Short and 
Windows Long formats. Additionally, the separator character and leading zeroes may be specified independent of the 
chosen format.

Uses the long date format specified in the Windows control panel or the Windows 95 Regional Settings control panel. 
Separator 
Choose from Standard (/), Period (.), Dash (-), Space ( ), and Comma (,). 
Leading Characters 
Specify the character to represent leading zeroes. 
Zero 
Leading zeroes display as zeroes (0). 
Blank 
Remove leading zeroes. 
Asterisk 
Leading zeroes display as asterisks (*). 
Two digit date range 
Change the default century interpretation for dates input with a two digit year. By default, Clarion assumes any date input 
with a two digit year (i.e. the century value is omitted) falls between today-80 years and today+19 years.  
For example, if today is June 1, 1996 and the date input is 9/2/59, Clarion assumes the 59 means 1959 since 1959 falls 
between today-80 years (June 1, 1916) and today+19 years (June 1, 2015). To force a different interpretation, set the 
Two Digit Date Range to 30. Now Clarion assumes the 59 means 2059 since 2059 falls between today-30 years (June 1, 
1966) and today+69 years (June 1, 2065).

The record group allows you to tailor the format file size. For example, if you are using very large list boxes, you may need 
to increase the format size. 
Name Size refers to the size of the Format name that will display in the popup menu and Format Editor. 
Format Size holds the list box FORMAT string, and Variable Size holds your formatting options. All all STRING 
data types, and should be sized accordingly. 
  
File Name Group: 
  
NameThe Default name of the format configuration file is FORMATS.FDB. If you need to change this for any reason, 
choose Other from the drop down list, and enter the new name in the Use Name prompt provided. When Other is 
selected, you may also modify the path of the format configuration file location. If the name of the format configuration file 
is stored in a variable, select the Variable option, and enter the variable name (without the prepending exclamation point) 
into the Variable Name prompt provided. 
PathThe default path of the format file is the program’s directory (folder). If you need to store this file in another location, 
enter the appropriate path. 
 
Make sure that your applications that share a common directory specify a different name or path for each application. This 
can avoid possible conflicts with stored format strings.

Table Relationship Dialog 
Dictionary 
Select this option to use the relationship as defined in the Dictionary. 
Custom 
Select this option to create an ad-hoc join between the files. This generates a JOIN statement. 
Inner 
Check this box to specify that this is an Inner join. This adds the INNER attribute to the JOIN statement. 
 
XP/Vista Manifest Support 
  
Include Default XP Manifest 
Check this box to include a default Manifest file in your application. When your program runs in the XP environment, this 
instructs the XP theme manager to render your controls with the new look and feel of the Windows XP environment. The 
manifest file is ignored on other Windows platforms (95/98, 2000, NT, and Vista). This option add the necessary 
MANIFEST logic to the application’s export file. 
 
The above setting should be used for XP Manifest only (e.g., applications running on a Windows XP O/S). If you plan to 
use a Vista Manifest, use the following options instead: 
Generate Manifest 
Check this box if you need to export an external XP manifest file that is associated with this application. This external 
manifest file is required when migrating your application to Clarion Win32, to support the latest XP visual styles and the 
extended UI support. 
Link Generated Manifest in Project 
Check this box to automatically include the external Manifest generated above into your distributed applications. This 
option eliminates the need for you to include the .manifest file with your application. 
Configure Manifest for Vista 
Check this box to enable additional options to be used with the Vista manifest. These options are explained in detail 
below: 
 
If you attempt to run an application on UAC-enabled Vista without an embedded manifest file, any code or user action 
event attempting to display a simple file dialog can throw unhandled security exceptions. There are many scenarios where 
you might need to elevate the UAC access level for standard users, especially when porting a legacy application to Vista, 
and a complete UAC-refactor is not possible. There are three levels available in an application manifest for invoking 
requested execution privileges. 
Vista Execution Level 
Choose from one of three execution privilege levels: 
asInvoker 
The standard user token is used to start the process. 
If your application doesn't require any special privileges, use the asInvoker execution level. Your users will run the 
program transparently without encountering a Vista popup each time they invoke it. Attempted writes to forbidden areas 
will fail rather than being virtualized. 
highestAvailable 
The application runs with the highest privileges the current user can obtain. 


---

IDE Reference 
114 
If your application doesn't require a full Administrator account but does require certain privileges, such as those accorded 
to accounts that are members of the Backup Operators group, use the highestAvailable execution level. An ordinary user 
will not encounter the elevation prompt and your app will not succeed in exercising the elevated privileges. A user who 
has one or more of the privileges that trigger Vista elevation will encounter the Vista elevation popup when he runs your 
application. If his account has sufficient privileges, your application will function as intended; otherwise not. 
requireAdministrator 
Prompt standard users for administrative credentials. 
If your application requires an account that is a member of the Administrators group, use the requireAdministrator 
execution level. This is necessary if your application writes to certain areas of the Windows Registry such as 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, needs to write within C:\Program Files or C:\Windows, needs to install drivers, or needs to 
perform other tasks that ordinary users are restricted from doing. Each time your application is run, the user will encounter 
the Vista elevation popup and will need to authorize your app to run. 
In summary, the execution level you choose for your manifest will depend on the requirements of your application. 
 
Applications ported from early versions of Windows that could (if built for Vista) work as standard-user applications may 
require administrative token access via the credentials prompt or administrative approval mode until they can successfully 
incorporate the best UAC practices. 
Application requires UIAccess 
Check this box to set the UIAccess to "True". In this state, the application is allowed to bypass UI protection levels to drive 
input to higher privilege windows on the desktop. This setting should only be used for UI Accessibility applications. 
With this option unchecked, the target application does not need to drive input to the UI of another window on the desktop. 
Applications that are not providing accessibility should set this flag to false. Applications that are required to drive input to 
other windows on the desktop (on-screen keyboard, for example) should set this value to true. 
Do you really need UIAccess? 
This capability is generally intended only for accessibility utilities. If you do need UIAccess enabled, then the 
executable needs to be digitally signed, and must be installed under %windir% or %ProgramFiles%. 
If Application requires UIAccess is set to FALSE (unchecked): 
The application does not need to drive input to the UI of another window on the desktop. Applications that are not 
providing accessibility should set this flag to false. Applications that are required to drive input to other windows on the 
desktop (on-screen keyboard, for example) should set this value to TRUE. 
If Application requires UIAccess is set to TRUE (checked): 
The application is allowed to bypass the UI protection levels to drive the input to higher privilege windows on the desktop. 
This setting should only be used for UI Accessibility applications. 
UIAccess is only enabled if the Vista execution level is set to requireAdministrator. 
  
Make controls inside the TAB transparent 
Sets the transparent (TRN) attribute to every OPTION, GROUP, RADIO, STRING, CHECK, and PROMPT controls that 
are placed inside a TAB control. This gives these controls a more pleasing appearance when displayed inside a TAB 
control that uses the new Visual Styles.

Tree Mode Views 
 
Application Tree Dialog - Category View 
In this view, the Application Tree dialog displays your procedures grouped by the Category you specify on the Procedure 
Properties dialog. The Procedure templates add a default value corresponding to their types to group procedures made 
with the same template together. You can create your own categories as you like.  
 
Application Tree Dialog - Modified View 
In this view, the Application Tree dialog displays your procedures sorted by the last modified date and time. The most 
recent changed procedure appears at the top of the list, while the oldest procedure appears at the bottom. If you ever 
need to trace when a problem arose, this view can assist you in which procedure could be the problem. 
 
Application Tree Dialog - Module View 
In module view, the Application Tree dialog displays your procedures according to the source code document which they 
reside in. A procedure is a collection of instructions--Clarion language statements--which perform a task. The first 
procedure your application executes is called "Main" by default. 
The tree controls in this dialog illustrate how the procedures reside in each separate file. Within each, they branch from 
each other when parent and child procedures reside in the same file. 
 
When you right-click on any procedure and select Module from the pop up menu, the Editor stores certain information 
about the files you open to edit. This is a productivity aid; it remembers the line number you were last at, and so if a file is 
opened, positioned to a certain line number, closed, then reopened, you are now back at the line where you were last 
positioned. 
 
Application Tree Dialog - Name View 
In alphabetic view, the Application Tree dialog displays your procedures according to the order of the procedure names. 
A procedure is a collection of instructions--Clarion language statements--which perform a task. The first procedure your 
application executes is called "Main" by default. 
Alphabetic view makes it easier to locate the precise procedure you wish to edit, when your application includes many 
procedures. There is also a Find command on the Edit menu, to help you locate the procedure you want when the 
Procedure tree is very long. 
The Application Tree shows the procedures you create when you add a menu item, toolbar command, or an embedded 
source procedure. Each new procedure is marked "To Do." When you "fill in" its functionality, the Application Tree dialog 
replaces the "To Do" with your description.

Application Tree Dialog - Procedure View 
In this, its default view, the Application Tree dialog displays your procedures in logical call tree, nesting each procedure 
under its calling procedure. A procedure is a collection of instructions--Clarion language statements--which perform a 
task. The first procedure your application executes is called "Main" by default. 
The tree controls in this dialog illustrate how the procedures branch from "Main" and from each other. This provides a 
schematic diagram of your program's logical structure. 
The Application Tree shows the procedures you create when you add a menu item, toolbar command, or an embedded 
source procedure. Each new procedure is marked "To Do." When you "fill in" its functionality, the Application Tree dialog 
replaces the "To Do" with your description. 
 
Application Tree Dialog - Template Type View 
In template type view, the Application Tree dialog groups all your procedures according to template type. A procedure is 
a collection of instructions--Clarion language statements--which perform a task. The first procedure your application 
executes is called "Main" by default. 
The Application Tree shows the procedures you create when you add a menu item, toolbar command, or an embedded 
source procedure. Each new procedure is marked "To Do." When you "fill in" its functionality, the Application Tree dialog 
replaces the "To Do" with your description.

Procedure Properties - Called Procedures 
Procedures may call other procedures. Procedure calls specified with template prompts are automatically added to the 
Application Tree; however, the Application Generator cannot "see" procedures called from embedded source code.  
Identifying these embedded procedure calls is important to project management and to source code generation. When 
you use the Procedures button to identify procedures called within embedded source code, the Application Generator 
can properly display the procedures within the Application Tree hierarchy, and the Application Generator can generate the 
appropriate local MAP structure for the source module. 
In addition, you can also use this feature for documenting external procedure calls and tables referenced therein.  
The Called Procedure dialog provides two ways to add procedures: 
  
Selection 
This tab control provides a complete list of all procedures defined in the 
application. Click on any procedure to identify it as a called procedure. You can 
also use the Select All and Deselect All to mark and unmark all procedures in the 
list.  
List 
This tab control provides an alternative method for adding called procedures. This 
technique is useful when there are too many procedures in your application and 
the Selection method becomes difficult. In the List section, you manually enter, 
change, delete and arrange the called procedures using the buttons provided.

IDE Reference 
118 
Procedure Properties 
These dialogs--each is customized according to the procedure template--contain entry boxes in which you can add a text 
description for the procedure, or specify its source code module, plus command buttons which lead to the dialogs which 
allow you to customize the procedure. 
Each procedure has its own custom help page which you can access by pressing the Help button on the Procedure 
Properties dialog. If you are using a third party template, or a template which you wrote yourself, this help topic will 
appear. 
Therefore, this help page only describes the essential elements of the Procedure Properties dialog; the controls which 
each procedure template builds upon. 
Clarion's Template language allows the template writer to add controls to the Procedure Properties dialog. These 
controls vary from template to template. Since each template performs a different task, the template writer provides 
whatever controls and options are necessary to gather input from you, the developer. Most of your input is stored in 
template variables (Template Symbols). When generating code, the Application Generator processes the template 
language code, and fills in the Template Symbols with the options you specify. As it does so, it generates your 
application's source code. 
A Procedure Properties dialog could have, for example, a checkbox to specify that an MDI window should save its 
position in the .INI file between sessions. Each template adds controls such as these to the Procedure Properties dialog, 
to gather choices from you. At code generation time, the Application Generator evaluates a symbol which stored your 
choice as to whether you wanted to save the MDI window position. If the checkbox was marked "yes," the Application 
Generator processes the template code containing the executable code to support saving the window position, and writes 
it to the generated source code file. 
  
Procedure Name 
The Procedure Name is displayed here. Press the ellipsis button to 
change the name if desired. You will be prompted for a New Procedure 
Name, and the ability to Accept or Discard your changes. 
Template 
The base template type used by this procedure is displayed here. You 
can change the template type by pressing the ellipsis button to the right. 
The Select Procedure Type dialog is displayed for a new selection if 
needed. 
Description 
A short text description for the procedure, which appears next to the 
procedure name in the Application Tree dialog. 
  
Press the ellipsis ( ... ) button to edit a longer (up to 1000 characters) 
description. 
Category 
A category is used to help you group procedures together when the 
Category Tree Mode is active. 
Module Name 
The source code file to hold the code for the procedure. Select from the 
dropdown list. By default, the Application Generator names modules by 
taking the first five characters of the .APP file name, then adding a three 
digit number for each module. 
Prototype 
Allows you to optionally type a custom procedure prototype which the 
Application Generator places in the MAP section.

Actions 
If any control templates were pre-defined in the current procedure 
template, or were in a window or report by you, this button accesses the 
Actions dialog for the control templates. 
  
Control templates provide "off the rack" controls, such as list boxes, and 
the code to maintain them. This allows you to start with a "bare" 
procedure template, such as the generic window, and add controls to 
create your own browse or form windows. 
Parameters 
Located in the Procedure Properties Actions dialog, this allows you to 
specify parameter names (an optional list of variables separated by 
commas) for your procedure, which you can pass to it from a calling 
procedure. You must specify the functionality for the parameters in 
embedded source code. 
Return Value 
Located in the Procedure Properties Actions dialog, this option lets you 
specify the variables receiving return values from functions (functions 
return values, procedures do not). 
 
Procedure Tabs 
In addition to the standard procedure prompts, there are Procedure Tabs that access other important procedure 
components: 
Window 
Calls the Window Editor and Designer, to visually design the window. 
  
In the Window Editor, the Edit as Text button allows you to quick edit the 
WINDOW or APPLICATION structure at the source code level. Clarion 
allows you to easily switch back and forth between editing the window 
graphically, and editing the source code that describes it. 
Press the Full Editor button to load and edit the WINDOW or 
APPLICATION structure in the full Text Editor. This editor enables full 
search capabilities, code folding, etc. 
 
Take care when hand-editing code for any WINDOW which contains a 
control template. The Application Generator stores Template Language 
attributes which cannot be edited by hand (#ORIG, #LINK, etc.). 
Report 
Calls the Report Editor and Designer, to visually design the procedure 
report structure if applicable.. 
In the Report Editor, the Edit as Text button allows you to edit the 
REPORT structure at the source code level. Clarion allows you to easily 
switch back and forth between editing the report graphically, and editing 
the source code that describes it.

The purpose of the Calls tab is to add procedures called in embedded source code. The normal way to add template 
procedures to the Application Tree is to create a menu or toolbar command, add the procedure name via its Actions 
button, and let the Application Generator automatically add it to the tree. 
Embeds 
Displays the Embedded Source dialog. You can then select either a 
field specific event or window related action, then add executable 
source code to customize how the procedure will handle it. 
  
After you choose an embed point in the Embedded Source dialog, you 
choose the code to execute. You can specify a call procedure, which is 
then added to the tree. You can write your own code with the text editor. 
Or, you can choose and customize a code template, which is a 
combination of pre-written code and prompts to "fill-in-the-blanks." 
  
Embedded source gives you complete control over all the processing in 
your procedures. It's one of the most powerful tools Clarion provides 
you.

Enter a value in hundredths of a second that specifies the timer interval 
for this process. The lower the number, the progress update will show a 
smoother display during process generation. The larger the interval, the 
less frequent the progress window will be refreshed. Use this setting 
when you plan to run multiple processes at the same time, and need to 
fine tune the intervals between process procedures. 
Quick-Scan 
Records 
Specifies buffered access behavior for ODBC, ASCII, DOS, or BASIC 
files. These file drivers read a buffer at a time (not a record), allowing for 
fast access. In a multi-user environment these buffers are not 100% 
trustworthy for subsequent access, because another user may change 
the file between accesses. As a safeguard, the driver rereads the buffers 
before each record access. To disable the reread, enable QUICKSCAN.

Record Filter 
Type an expression to limit the contents of the process to only those 
records which match the filter expression. This filters all displayable 
records. When a Record filter is used in conjunction with a Range Limit, 
only those records within the specified range are filtered. See Also: Using 
Range Limits and Filters  
  
 
You must BIND columns used in a filter expression. See Hot Fields below. 
  
Additional Sort Fields 
Type a comma delimited list of fields on which to sort. 
These sort fields are in addition to the key for the report 
set in the Data / Tables Pad dialog. If no key is specified, 
this is the sort order used allowing you to sort records 
without a key.  
Record Count Override 
When processing in record order (no key), this number is 
used to calculate what percentage of the operation is 
complete to provide feedback to the end user. If you don't 
specify a number, the process "counts" the records 
before processing begins. This can be relatively fast or 
slow depending on the file system and the file size. You 
must supply an appropriate record count when you use a 
Record Filter (or a Range Limit that results in a filter). 
Set progress bar limits manually 
Clear this box to make your procedure read the result set 
and set the progress bar limits automatically. Setting 
limits automatically may produce poor performance for 
some SQL data sets, or erratic or inaccurate progress 
indicator for unevenly distributed result sets. Check this 
box to manually provide progress bar limits for the 
procedure. Setting manual limits can provide faster 
performance for SQL drivers and more accurate progress 
indicators for unevenly distributed result sets. This setting 
is only effective if you specify a Key for the File in the 
Data / Tables Pad dialog. 
Low Progress Bar Limit 
Supply the lowest "free" key element value for the result 
set. You may type the value or the label of a variable 
containing the value. Enclose literal string values in single 
quotes ('value'). 
High Progress Bar Limit 
Supply the highest "free" key element value for the result 
set. You may type the value or the label of a variable 
containing the value. Enclose literal string values in single 
quotes ('value').

Range Limits 
Range Limit Field 
Type in the field name or press the ellipsis (...) button to select the field 
from the Component list. The Range Limit Field must be a component of 
the Access Key specified in the Data / Tables Pad. The range limit is 
key-dependent; the generated source code uses the SET statement to 
find the first valid record. 
Range Limit Type 
When a field is selected for Range Limit Field, this specifies the method 
of determining the records for inclusion in the list box. 
  
Current Value -- Signifies the value contained in the key field at the 
beginning of the ACCEPT loop. This is the value used for the range for 
the duration of the procedure. 
  
Single Value -- Specifies a variable containing the limiting value. Only 
records matching the variable are included. Enter a variable in the 
Range Limit Value box which appears, or press the ellipses (...) button 
to select the variable from the Select Column dialog. 
  
Range of Values -- Lets you specify upper and lower limits. Enter a 
variable in the Low Limit and High Limit Value boxes which appears, or 
press the ellipses (...) button to select the variables from the Select 
Column dialog. 
  
File Relationship -- Lets you choose a range limiting file from a 1:MANY 
relationship. The Range Limiting field must be the "One" side of a One-
to-Many Relationship with the Primary File used in the Process. The 
relation's linking key must be the same as the Access Key for the 
procedure. Enter a file in the Related File box, or press the ellipses (...) 
button to select it from the Select Column dialog. 
  
Hot Fields 
You must BIND any variables or EQUATEs used in a filter expression. Press Insert to add the variable to the Hot Fields 
list, and check the Bind Field box.

Procedure Properties--Source  
The Source Procedure template provides an elegant and simple way to add hand code to your application. By default, it 
provides simple source points at which to embed your code: the data section, code section, local procedures and routines.  
The template simply declares the procedure, handles any optional parameters, places the embedded data declarations in 
the data section, begins the CODE section, then places any embedded executable code in the CODE section: 
Description 
A short text description for the procedure, which appears next to the 
procedure name in the Application Tree dialog. 
  
Press the ellipsis ( ... ) button to edit a longer (up to 1000 characters) 
description. 
Category 
Use this field to group your procedures in the Category Tab of the 
Application Tree. The Procedure templates add a default value 
corresponding to their types to group procedures made with the same 
template together. You can create your own categories as you like.  
Prototype 
Lets you optionally type a custom procedure prototype which the 
Application Generator places in the MAP section. See Prototyping and 
Parameter Passing with the Application Generator 
Module Name 
The source code file to hold the code for the procedure. Select from the 
drop down list. By default, the Application Generator names modules by 
taking the first five characters of the .APP file name, then adding a three 
digit number for each module. 
Declare Globally 
Check this box to generate the procedure's prototype into the 
PROGRAM's MAP, rather than the MODULE's MAP. This makes the 
procedure callable from any other procedure, but it also forces a 
recompile of all program modules whenever you change the prototype.  
Export Procedure 
Declares the procedure in the export file, enabling it to be called by 
another application. Note:This checkbox is only available when the target 
file specified in Application Properties is a Dynamic Link Library (.DLL). 
Parameters 
Lets you specify parameter names (an optional list of variables separated 
by commas, with the entire list surrounded by parentheses) for your 
procedure, which you can pass to it from a calling procedure. You must 
specify the functionality for the parameters in embedded source code. See 
Also: PROCEDURE Calls . 
Generate 
Open/Close Files 
Routines 
Check this box to generate an OpenFiles and a CloseFiles ROUTINE for 
access in your source procedure. Files that you add in the Other Tables 
entry point in the Data / Tables Pad dialog will be automatically 
processed in these ROUTINES. You will still have to explicitly reference 
these ROUTINES in your hand code (i.e., DO OpenFiles, DO CloseFiles)

Generate 
Save/Restore Files 
Routines 
Check this box to generate a SaveFiles and a RestoreFiles ROUTINE for 
access in your source procedure. Files that you add in the Other Tables 
entry point in the Data / Tables Pad dialog will be automatically 
processed in these ROUTINES. You will still have to explicitly reference 
these ROUTINES in your hand code (i.e., DO SaveFiles, DO 
RestoreFiles). The SaveFiles saves a file’s position, as well as any active 
HOLD or WATCH. It also saves a copy of the managed file's record 
buffer contents.

Procedure Properties--Splash  
The Splash Template generates code to display a window with an image and some text on a 3-D bevelled panel. The 
window closes automatically after a specified amount of time. In addition, you can optionally allow the user to close the 
window at any time by CLICKING on it.  
Frame procedures are designed to optionally call Splash procedures. Alternatively, you can call Splash procedures with 
embedded source code. 
By convention, a splash procedure provides a visual or audio (or both) fanfare for your program. A splash screen can 
provide a recognizable logo or icon whose familiarity may raise the user's comfort level and may serve as an 
advertisement for your program. Additionally it diverts the user's attention from the sometimes boring task of loading and 
initializing the program.

Procedure Property Tabs  
  
 
  
Report Properties 
General 
Print Preview 
Check this box to enable previewing of a report before printing. When 
checked the Preview Options tab will appear. 
Data Source 
Your report can read data to be processed from a target data file (or 
table), a queue, or from memory. 
  
If you select File from the drop list, options for Quick Scan, Record Filter, 
Additional Sort Fields, Record Count Override, and Progress Bar Limits 
are available (and discussed below). 
  
If you select Queue from the Data Source drop list, a Queue Name 
entry is displayed. Press the E button to the right of the Queue Name 
prompt to select a target queue that the report will read from. The report 
reads the queue in record sequence, so it will be important to make sure 
that the queue is built and sorted properly prior to printing. 
  
Finally, if you select Memory from the Data Source drop list, the report 
will not process (e.g., loop through) the report file designated in the 
report procedure’s Table Schematic. Essentially, this setting is used to 
print a "snapshot" of the populated report elements and their values 
when the print process is called. 
  
 
If you select Memory or Queue as your data source, you will still have to designate a primary table in the Table Schematic 
dialog. This table, however, will not be processed when these alternative data sources are selected. 
  
MDI Progress Window 
Check this box to specify that the Progress Window 
generated for this report will be MDI. This option is 
necessary if you plan to allow multiple reports to run on 
different threads at the same time. The disadvantage to 
this could be a slight reduction in report generation 
performance. DO NOT check this box if your report 
procedure is not threaded.

Progress Interval Timer 
Enter a value in hundredths of a second that specifies the 
timer interval for this report. The lower the number, the 
progress update will show a smoother display during 
report generation. The larger the interval, the less 
frequent the progress window will be refreshed. Use this 
setting when you plan to run multiple reports at the same 
time, and need to fine tune the intervals between report 
procedures. 
Quick-Scan Records 
Specifies buffered access behavior for ODBC, ASCII, 
DOS, or BASIC files. These file drivers read a buffer at a 
time (not a record), allowing for fast access. In a multi-
user environment these buffers are not 100% trustworthy 
for subsequent access, because another user may 
change the file between accesses. As a safeguard, the 
driver rereads the buffers before each record access. To 
disable the reread, enable QUICKSCAN.  
Record Filter 
Type an expression to limit the contents of the browse list 
to only those records which match the filter expression. 
Press the E button to call the Expression Editor, to help 
you construct syntactically correct expressions.  
  
This filters all displayable records. When a Record filter is 
used in conjunction with a Range Limit, only those records 
within the specified range are filtered. See Also: Using 
Range Limits and Filters 
Additional Sort Fields 
Type a comma delimited list of fields on which to sort. 
These sort fields are in addition to the key for the report 
set in the Data / Tables Pad. If no key is specified, this is 
the sort order used allowing you to sort records without a 
key. 
IPDRV Options 
If you are using the IP Driver in your application, press this 
button to access the IPDRV Options dialog. 
Record Count Override 
Specify an approximate record count if the report is 
filtered. The progress indicator uses this value to 
calculate the percent completed value. 
Set progress bar limits 
manually? 
Clear this box to make your procedure read the result set 
and set the progress bar limits automatically. Setting 
limits automatically may produce poor performance for 
some SQL data sets, or erratic or inaccurate progress 
indicator for unevenly distributed result sets. Check this 
box to manually provide progress bar limits for the 
procedure. Setting manual limits can provide faster 
performance for SQL drivers and more accurate progress 
indicators for unevenly distributed result sets. This setting 
is only effective if you specify a Key for the File in the 
Data / Tables Pad.

Low Progress Bar Limit 
Supply the lowest "free" key element value for the result 
set. You may type the value or the label of a variable 
containing the value. Enclose literal string values in single 
quotes ('value'). 
High Progress Bar Limit 
Supply the highest "free" key element value for the result 
set. You may type the value or the label of a variable 
containing the value. Enclose literal string values in single 
quotes ('value'). 
  
Report Target 
This tab control and its options are only available if you have the Advanced Report Generation templates enabled. The 
options here allow you to designate a default report target and method to use with these supported templates. 
  
 
If this tab control does not appear after including the Advanced Report Generation Global , Extension, make sure to 
refresh the template generation sequence by selecting Source or Embeds in the proper procedure. 
  
Report Target 
From the drop list, select the initial output the report is to be directed to. If 
you select Printer, the report defaults to a standard printed output. 
Selecting Other enables the Other Target prompt, where you can select a 
different output type by default. Select Ask at Runtime to allow a popup 
window to display before the report begins to process. The window 
displayed at runtime would look something like this: 
  
 
  
Add Print like an 
option 
This option is only available if you have selected Ask as Runtime as the 
report target. Check this box to include standard printer output as a user 
selectable choice at runtime.

This drop list is only available if you select Other as your Report Target 
option. Select from HTML, PDF, TXT or XML as your default report target.

If you have more than one "Report To" template set active, you can always change the default target at runtime in the 
Print Preview window. Simply select File > Save As from the menu, and a list of valid report outputs will be displayed for 
selection. 
  
Hidden Controls 
Each Advanced Report Generation template has the option to hide 
controls that are not applicable to its output. The idea is to have special 
controls populated on your report for different types of outputs. For 
example, you may have a field on a report that stores the proper tag 
information for a PDF document, and in the same area a hot link tag for 
HTML. In the Report to HTML template, you can hide the PDF Bookmark 
field, and in the Report to PDF template, hide the HTML specific control.  
The Hidden Controls button displays a list box of ALL controls hidden for 
all available formats that you have enabled. This allows you to quickly 
search for a control that needs your attention. 
  
  
Range Limits 
Range Limit Field 
In conjunction with the Range Limit Type, specifies a record or group of 
records for inclusion in the report. Choose a field by pressing the ellipsis 
(...) button. The Range Limit Field must be a component of the report's 
Access Key. The range limit is key-dependent; the generated source 
code uses the SET statement to find the first valid record. 
Range Limit Type 
Specifies the type of range limit to apply. Choose one of the following 
from the drop-down list. 
  
Current Value signifies the current value of the Range Limit Field. 
  
Single Value lets you limit the list to a single value. Specify the variable 
containing that value in the Range Limit Value box which appears. 
  
Range of Values lets you specify upper and lower limits. Specify the 
variable containing the values in the Low Limit and High Limit Value 
boxes. 
  
File Relationship lets you choose a range limiting file from a 1:MANY 
relationship. This limits the report to display only those child records 
matching the current record in the Parent file. For example, if your report 
is a list of Orders, you could limit the output to only those orders for the 
current Customer (in the Customer file). 
  
See Also: Using Range Limits and Filters

The Preview Options tab lets you control the initial appearance of the report preview window. This tab is only available if 
you check the Print Preview box on the General tab.

report will be MDI. This option is necessary if you plan to allow multiple 
reports to run on different threads at the same time. The disadvantage to 
this could be a slight reduction in report generation performance. DO 
NOT check this box if your report procedure is not threaded. 
  
Breaks 


---

IDE Reference 
142 
The Breaks tab provides support for adding embedded break logic that is not associated with any bands or break 
structures on the report. The two uses for this type of logic are used in totaling and conditional headers and footers. The 
breaks defined here are solely based on field (column) values, and are not associated with any particular band (as in the 
traditional breaks). 
Press the INSERT button to add a new break. You can also change or delete an existing break, or change the break order 
by using the appropriate move up/move down buttons. 
 
Each break that is created generates embed points that the developer can use to initialize (Take Start), analyze (Update 
Total), and reset (Take End) each program break. These embeds are provided by the Break Manager Class, which is the 
internal logic that supports the template interface. Press the Embeds button, and search for Break Manager to locate 
these embed points. 
In the Break dialog window, the following prompts are provided: 
  
Name: 
Enter a descriptive name for the embedded break that you are creating. 
New Break Level 
0? 
Embedded breaks can be nested. For example, one break can be a 
totaling break whose result is used in a second totaling break. Check this 
box if the break will not be dependent on another break. 
Fields 
Fields are the elements that trigger break logic. Each time the field 
contents changes, and embedded break is triggered. Additional fields 
may be added, and any field whose contents changes will generate the 
break. 
Totaling 
Each time that an embedded break is generated, a total result may be 
calculated. Press the Insert button to create a total field that will be 
calculated when the break is triggered.  
Target Field 
Press the ellipsis button to select a target field that will hold the totaling 
result. 
Type 
From the drop list, select Count, Sum, Average, SumPro or Weighted 
Average to determine the type of totaling that need to be performed on 
the break. 
Source Field 
Press the ellipsis button to select a source field that will be used as the 
totaling value. 
Source Field 
(Weight) 
Press the ellipsis button to select a source field that will be used as the 
additional element in the SumPro or Weighted Average value as 
follows: 
  
SumPro += (Source Field * Source Field (Weight)) 
  
Weighted Average = SumPro(Source Field * Source Field (Weight))/Sum(Source 
Field (Weight)) 
Do Total On 
Specify that the total will be calculated on All Records, or a Condition 
that is specified below.

generated. 
  
Header and Footer 
An embedded break can be used to generate a conditional header or footer on a page. An example of this might be a 
multi-page invoice, where the header of the first page may differ from the header of the second page. In this case, you 
can create an extra detail section that is used as your "Page Two", and triggers on a page number embedded break. 
Print Header? 
Check this box if you would like to generate a header detail when 
an embedded break is detected. Select a detail band to use for the 
generated Header. 
Print Footer? 
Check this box if you would like to generate a footer detail when an 
embedded break is detected. Select a detail band to use for the 
generated Footer. 
  
Hot Fields 
You must BIND any variables or EQUATEs used in a filter expression. Press Insert to add the variable to the Hot Fields 
list, and check the Bind Field box. 
For the use of Hot Fields with embedded breaks, check the Restore Field on Break check box. This will store a copy of 
the hot field value of the previous record read. When an embedded break is detected, the previous record value is 
restored for printing. 
Detail Filters 
Each Detail band is listed in the Detail Filters list. To restrict printing of a band, highlight it in the list, then press the 
Properties button. Provide an expression in the Filter field. The band will only print when this expression is true. Press the 
E button to call the Expression Editor. This dialog is used to help you construct syntactically correct expressions to use in 
the prompt. 
Optionally, check the Exclude unfiltered box to restrict any other detail band which does not have a filter expression of 
its own. 
The Additional Filters display will show any filters that are generated by other report support templates (like the 
ReportChild Extension). 
Classes Tab 
Use the Classes tab to override the global settings for the Class. See Classes Tab.

IP Driver Options 
  
This dialog is useful if you are using the IP Driver addon product, and is accessible through the Procedure Properties > 
Report Behavior > General > IPDRV Options.  
The IP Driver is used for data access and transfer over an IP protocol. More information regarding this powerful addon 
can be found at the SoftVelocity web site. 
  
Use MRP (Multiple Request Packet) 
The IP Driver Version 2.0 introduced the use of Multiple Request Packets (MRP). MRPs are designed to improve the 
performance of data transfer via IP protocol, by packaging multiple requests (records) into a single IP data packet.  
If MRP use is set to ON in a BROWSE procedure, the IP Driver returns a full page of records from the server, instead of 
one record at a time. In a Report or Process, the MRP is set to the value of RecordsPerCycle. The MRP reduces the 
roundtrips to the server dramatically. However, if you are doing hand-coded file access for each record read (i.e., NEXT, 
GET, ADD, PUT, etc.) inside the LOOP structure used to fill the List control, or during a Report or Process Procedure, set 
this checkbox to FALSE (unchecked).

Formula Editor 
 
Conditional Dialog 
A conditional field is a computed field with multiple possible expressions. There are two types of conditional fields--IF 
structures and CASE structures. The assignment statement executed depends on the evaluation of the IF or CASE 
condition. For example, an IF structure conditional field called Tax could be 0 if Taxable is FALSE, or Price times TaxRate 
if Taxable is TRUE. 
The Formula Editor allows you to create a conditional expression whose result can then be assigned to a variable. Name 
your conditional formula in the Formula Editor dialog, then press the Conditionals button to open this dialog. 
Each portion of the expression is edited separately. The components appear in the Structure list in the lower portion of 
the dialog box. Select a component, then edit it in the Statement box. You can add and/or nest IF and CASE structures by 
pressing the IF THEN and CASE OF buttons. 
Statement 
A currently selected component (displayed in the Structure list) of the actual 
expression under construction. 
Information Describes the currently selected component in the Statements box. 
Check 
Tests and validates currently selected component of the expression under 
construction. A check box appears if it is syntactically correct. An "X" appears if 
not.

Browse (List Box) Behavior 
 
Scroll Bar Behavior 
Alpha distribution 
The Alpha distribution divides the scroll bar into 26 segments--one for each letter of the alphabet. Moving the thumb to a 
segment displays the first record beginning with the segment corresponding letter. For example, moving the thumb to the 
third segment displays the first record beginning with the letter c. If no records begin with c, the record with the closest 
higher value is highlighted. 
Last Names distribution 
The Last Names distribution divides the scroll bar into 100 segments. Each of these segments is assigned a value based 
on the distribution of names in an average U.S. telephone book. Each segment is assigned a value and positioning the 
thumb at that segment displays the first record matching that value. If no records begin with the value, the record with the 
next closest higher value is highlighted. 
The pre-defined Last name distribution is a more accurate method than Alpha when displaying names because names 
are not evenly distributed alphabetically.  
For example, the Browse Box control template uses these values 
<null> 
ALB 
AME 
ARN 
BAK 
BAT 
BEN 
... 
 
Positioning the thumb on the third segment, highlights the first record beginning with the letters AME. If no records match, 
the next highest next closest higher value is highlighted. 
Fixed Thumb 
A fixed thumb positions the thumb (or elevator bar) in the center of the scroll bar. Clicking in the scroll bar above the 
thumb moves up one page at a time. Clicking in the scroll bar below the thumb moves down one page at a time. 
Movable Thumb 
A movable thumb positions the thumb (or elevator bar) at the top of the scroll bar when the browse box is initialized. 
Clicking in the scroll bar above the thumb moves up one page at a time. Clicking in the scroll bar below the thumb moves 
down one page at a time. Draging the the thumb up or down to a position, highlights the closest matching record for that 
position in the scroll bar. This is dependant on the type of vertical scroll bar behavior you specify.  
Custom 
This lets you specify the break points for distribution along the scroll bar. This is useful when you have data with a skewed 
distribution. Insert the values for each point in the list. This divides the length of the scroll bar into segments. Each value 
you insert in the list creates a segment. For example, if you specify ten values, the scroll bar is divided into ten segments. 
Positioning the thumb on the third segment, highlights the first record beginning with the value of the value of the third 
item you've inserted in the list. If no records match, the next highest next closest higher value is highlighted.  
You can use numeric or string constants, or variables. String constants should be enclosed in single quotes ( ' ).

IDE Reference 
152 
Runtime 
The Browse Box is initialized and computes the values for 100 break points based on the first and last record in the 
Range.The distribution points are determined only when the file is opened, therefore there is no performance penalty. The 
lowest value in the key is subtracted from the highest value to estimate the range of numbers, 100 evenly distributed 
points in that range are determined and used to control the vertical scroll bar behavior. 
 
Locator Properties 
Step 
The user types in a single character to advance the cursor bar in the list box to the record that contains the nearest match 
in the key field. Use this type of locator only when the first Free Key Element is a STRING, CSTRING, or PSTRING. If no 
free key element is available, the application generator converts a step locator to None. 
Entry Locator 
An entry box holds the value for the locator. When the end user places a value in the entry box, pressing TAB or 
reselecting the list box moves the selection to the nearest matching record. If an entry control is not placed in the window, 
the application generator converts an Entry locator to a Step locator.  
If you use the same field more than once as a locator, you must override the default locator. For example, if you have a 
multi-keyed browse which has an ascending key and a descending key on the same field. To use separate controls (as on 
separate TABs) for each condition, check the override box and select the second instance from the drop-down list.  
Incremental Locator 
When the end user types one or more characters, the list box moves the selection to the nearest matching record. 
Backspace clears the characters, one-by-one, moving the highlight bar to the nearest matching record of the remaining 
characters. If a STRING control is placed in the window, the characters display, allowing the user to see the characters as 
they are entered or cleared. If an ENTRY control is placed in the window, the locator works like an Entry Locator when 
the entry control has focus. 
If you use the same field more than once as a locator, you must override the default locator. For example, if you have a 
multi-keyed browse which has an ascending key and a descending key on the same field. To use separate controls (as on 
separate TABs) for each condition, check the override box and select the second instance from the drop-down list.

Range Limit Prompts 
Using Range Limits and Filters 
There are many times that you will want to view, process, or report a sub-set of records from a file. There are two ways to 
do this: 
1. Range Limit 
2. Filters 
Each method has its tradeoffs. Range Limits are much faster to process, but they require that a procedure or control use a 
limited key as the primary key. Filters are more flexible, since they don't require any special key manipulation, but they are 
much slower. In any procedure that does sequential processing, you can specify a Range Limit Field, and the type of 
Range Limit you want to use. The types provided are: 
Current Value -Value Limited Keyed Access  
The key element specified in the Range Limit Field prompt is the final Fixed Key Element. With this kind of Range Limit, 
the value of all Fixed Key Elements are saved when the procedure is initialized. These values are used for the duration of 
the procedure. 
Single Value-Value Limited Keyed Access 
The key element specified in the Range Limit Field prompt is the final Fixed Key Element. With this kind of Range Limit, 
the values of all Fixed Key Elements EXCEPT the final Fixed Key Element are saved when the procedure is initialized. 
The final Fixed Key Element is assigned the value specified in the Range Limit value prompt. This value can be either a 
variable or fixed value. This value is reevaluated each time a page or entry is loaded or processed. 
Range of Values -Ranged Key Access 
The key element specified in the Range Limit Field prompt is the first Free Key Element. With this kind of Range Limit, the 
values of all Fixed Key Elements except the final Fixed Key Element are saved when the procedure is initialized. The Low 
Limit and High Limit Values are used to set the keys for sequential access and to evaluate each record read to insure it is 
within the valid range. These values can be either fixed values or variables. If variables are used, these variables are 
reevaluated each time a page or entry is loaded or processed. 
There is also support in this dialog for the Higher Key Component, which allows you to specify a secondary key 
component for Single Values and Range of Values, and then prime the higher component values accordingly. 
Browse Box Only - File Relationship - Value Limited Key Access 
All Fixed Key Elements are assigned values as defined in a relationship in the data dictionary. With this kind of Range 
Limit, it is possible to have multiple Browse Box control templates populated on a window, and as long as the 
relationships are defined and used, when a parent Browse Box goes out of range, all children (and grandchildren, etc.) 
Browse Boxes and Controls will automatically be reconstructed. 
You must BIND any variables or EQUATEs used in a filter expression. Add the variable to the Hot Fields list, and check 
the Bind Field box. 
Current Value 
Signifies the value contained in the key field at the beginning of the ACCEPT loop. This is the value used for the range for 
the duration of the procedure. 
Single Value 
Specifies a variable containing the limiting value. Only records matching the variable are included. The variable is 
reevaluated whenever the window is refreshed. Enter a variable in the Range Limit Value box which appears, or press the 
ellipses (...) button to select the variable from the Select a Component… dialog. 
Range of Values 
Lets you specify upper and lower limits. Enter a variable in the Low Limit and High Limit Value boxes which appears, or 
press the ellipses (...) button to select the variables from the Select a Component… dialog.

IDE Reference 
154 
Higher Key Component 
The Higher Key Component dialog is used to specify range criteria for key elements that are higher in order than the 
range key field you have selected as the primary range limit component. 
For example, you may have a key defined with a date field and customer number. The key’s primary sort (higher 
component) is the date field, followed by the customer number as the secondary sort. If you choose the customer number 
as the primary range limit component for your browse, you must also prime the higher key component (date in this 
example) with a designated value. Failure to do this would cause your range limit to fail on all records, since no date field 
is zero or NULL. 
Based on the key name that you have selected, the higher key component will already be present in this dialog’s list box. 
To modify the default setting displayed, highlight the target component, and press the Properties button. 
Key Field 
This field simply displays the key component you have selected. 
Value Type 
Choose Current Value, Variable Value, or Fixed Value from the drop list. 
Current Value 
Primes the key component with the current value stored in the record buffer prior to opening the list box. 
Variable Value 
Press the ellipsis button next to the Value field to assign a variable’s value to the selected key component. 
Fixed Value 
Enter a constant value or expression that will be assigned to the selected key component. 
File Relationship 
Lets you choose a range limiting file from a 1:MANY relationship. The Range Limiting field must be the "One" side of a 
One-to-Many Relationship with the Browse Box's Primary File. The relation's linking key must be the same as the Access 
Key for the Browse Box. Enter a file in the Related File box, or press the ellipses (...) button to select it from the Select 
Table… dialog. 
Fixed Key Element 
A Fixed Key Element is an element of a KEY that has a fixed value for the displayable records. For example, when setting 
a range limit of a single value, all key components up to and including the range limit field have a fixed value. Any key 
components following the Fixed Key Elements are Free Key Elements.

Database Browser 
Database Browser Menu Commands 
The Database Browser allows you direct access to data files without requiring you to create an application. The only entry 
constraint is the data type assigned to a column.  
The Database Browser offers neither data Validity Checking nor Referential Integrity Constraints. This is a programmer's 
tool; there are no controls to prevent you from making changes that could compromise the integrity of the database. 
The IDE menu is not associated with any activity of the Database Browser. Some of the menu commands, most notably 
on the Build and Tools menus, do not specifically reference Database Browser functions. Because the Project System 
and the Registries are always active, their menu commands are always available. 
  
Access to the Database Browser is accomplished by any of the following actions. 
• 
Using the Start Page Tables link: 
 
• 
From the DCT Explorer, press the Browse Table toolbar button: 
 
• 
From the IDE Menu, select Tools > Browse Table 
  
Database Browser Toolbar 
The Database Browser toolbar has three simple options: 
Open 
Use this option to open additional tables. Each table is opened on a separate MDI tab control. 
Save 
Press the Save button to save any changes that you have made to the table. As you close the table, changes not saved 
will be detected and you will be prompted to save any changes. 
Tables in an unsaved state are marked with an asterisk ( * ) on the IDE Tab control. 
Display Order 
The drop list displays all defined keys of the selected table, and in addition also includes simple Record Order. Select an 
option from the drop list to change the sort order of the active table. 
  
Editing Options 
The new Database Browser uses a .NET Data Grid control to display the active file contents.  
To edit any column, simply double-click on it. Press the Enter key, or click on another column to complete the edit 
session. Press the Save button on the toolbar to permanently save the changes. 
To delete any record, click on the left most "selection" column on the row to select the entire row, and press the Delete 
key on your keyboard.

The new Database Browser also includes advanced locator and filtering options.  
Find Options  
Filter Options  
 
Find Dialog 
The Find dialog is used to locate the first matching record, based on a simple "field = value" query. It must find an exact 
match. 
A convenient drop list is provided with a list of valid Field (or Column) names. 
In the Field prompt, select a column from the drop list. Enter a valid search criteria in the Value entry. The value to search 
for must be an exact match. String values should not be quoted. 
 
Filter Dialog 
The Database Browser contains a powerful Filter dialog. Use this dialog to range limit a group of records that match 
your criteria.  
You can use the "assisted" dialog (shown above) to filter records based on a simple expression. 
If your filter expression is more complex, check the Free Form box and entire the desired search criteria. 
Some rules when using the free form style: 
• 
If the file has a prefix the Filter expression requires the use of [ ] as in [prefix:fieldname] 
• 
String values on the right hand side of the expression must be enclosed in single quotes. 
• 
LIKE can use either % or * for a wildcard at front or back of the value: 
e.g., LIKE '%test', LIKE '*test', LIKE '%est%' 
• 
The IN operator takes a list of values enclosed in parentheses: 
e.g., LastName IN ('Bagley','Cade'), Zipcode IN (33062, 33358) 
Press the Apply Filter button to execute the query and display the filtered records in the view window. 
Press the Remove Filter button to clear all filter values and display all records of the table.

Dictionary Diagrammer 
  
The purpose of the Dictionary Diagrammer is to provide a graphical representation of an existing data dictionary. Tables, 
columns, keys and relationships information are provided, and you have the option to control the level of detail. After 
completing the diagram to your specifications, you can print it, or save it in a variety of image formats. You will be happy 
with its ease of use and intuitive design. 
Here is a quick start guide to using this powerful new IDE tool: 
To create a new Diagram: 
  
1. Open the Start Page, and select the Diagrams hyperlink. 
2. Press the New button. 
3. When prompted, enter a name for the new Diagram file (DCD extension). 
4. When the next dialog opens select the desired Dictionary (DCT extension). 
  
To open an existing Diagram: 
  
You have several options;  
From the File menu choose the Open Recent Dictionary Diagrams menu item. 
Or, 
Click the Open toolbar button and change the file mask to 'Dictionary Diagram (*.dcd) 
Or, 
Go to the Start Page, select the Diagrams hyperlink, and select the target Diagram to open from the list. or simply press 
the Open button. 
  
  
General Usage: 
There are two list boxes presented; Dictionary Tables and Diagram Tables 
• 
Dictionary Tables represents all tables in the DCT that are NOT on the Diagram. 
• 
Diagram Tables represents all of the tables included in the Diagrammer 
Incremental locators are implemented for both of these lists. 
Together the 2 lists represent all of the tables in the active dictionary. Adding tables to the Diagram Tables list 
automatically removes it from the Dictionary Tables list(and vice versa). 
Clicking on a table in the diagram table should display its properties in 'Table Information' tab. 
  
To add tables to the Diagram 
Double-Click on any table in the Dictionary Tables list 
OR 
Select one or more tables and press the 
 button.

Working with the Diagram component: 
Here are a few tips to consider when working with the Diagrammer. 
• 
Sometimes when a table has many relations or lookups, a table can be drawn on top of another, just click on the 
Table title area and drag it to the desired location. You can also right-click on an empty area of the Diagram, and 
from the context menu choose Auto-Arrange Tables. 
• 
When you turn on Relationship Descriptions from the context menu, description text can intersect the Tables. 
To resolve this, simply drag the tables to the desired location. Sometimes you may see a row in the table that 
appears empty, make the table slightly wider to see the text. 
• 
Tables displayed on the Diagram are graphical objects. As such, there are a few things you can do to have a 
better Diagrammer experience: 
 
Usually Diagrams of several hundred tables are not very easy to comprehend, and you are usually better off to 
create multiple Diagrams instead of one huge Diagram. 
 
If you do intend to add hundreds of tables to a Diagram, then we recommend two things that can make that 
configuration work more efficiently; first, set the Zoom level to 25%, then add all of the tables at one time. This 
decreases the number of times the component has to re-arrange table locations to match Parent->Child tables, 
and reduces the demands on your graphics subsystem to draw the tables. Second, to work with hundreds of 
tables -- the more graphics horsepower the better! 
  
 
  
Caveats in this release: 
• 
Table lists are currently not sorted 
• 
Currently, when closing you are not prompted to save the diagram (but the Save toolbar button does save it). 
• 
SQL toolbar button is disabled. 
• 
Open toolbar button is disabled. 
• 
Option to print to PDF is disabled. 
• 
Context Menu (from inside table area) will be hooked to DCT Editor edit forms 
• 
Option to set paper size, etc. for Print Preview are not implemented.

Dictionary Diagrammer Options 
This dialog allows you to fine tune and tailor many of the display and output options of the Dictionary Diagrammer tool 
when first opened. 
  
 
Again, all of these settings in this dialog apply only to NEW diagrams. Once you saved a diagram, all of your settings are 
saved with it, including for example, the zoom factor. 
  
General-Diagram 
Initial Scale (Percentage) 
Set the default Zoom percentage here. This setting will be active as the new Diagram is first opened. 
Grid Options 
Set the grid display techniques. You can specify that the grid is dotted (Points), a solid line (Lines), or neither (None). 
General-Tables 
Display Relationship Description 
Check this box to display the full relationship description. 
Display Table Grid Lines 
The settings above here control the initial grid type and display settings. You can display points, lines or none in the 
Diagrammer. 
Initial Size for Tables 
Expanded displays all elements of the diagram. Collapsed displays a condensed list. Name Only displays the table name 
only. 
  
Appearance 
These settings control the initial colors displayed for the diagram and table backgrounds. The settings made here will 
ONLY apply to NEW diagrams that you create. To change existing attributes of a diagram, use the context popup menu 
provided in the diagrammer. 
Diagram Background Color 
Select from the drop list a background color to be applied to your new diagrams. 
Table Font Color 
Set the default font color to display for all textual elements in your new Diagram.

Rearrange Tables when Expanding or Collapsing 
When you toggle the Expand or Collapse state of tables, the default behavior of the Diagrammer will rearrange the layout 
to either move tables further apart to prevent tables overlaying one another (if Expanding), or move the tables closer 
together to reduce excess whitespace (if Collapsing). If you already have your tables arranged exactly how you want 
them, you can set this checkbox to OFF (unchecked), and the tables will not be rearranged. 
Printing 
Print Diagram Background Color 
Check this box to print the diagram background color

Diagrammer Reports View 
The purpose of the Diagrammer Reports View is to give you a powerful visual comparison of key elements in your 
dictionary. With the Reports View, you can easily locate discrepancies or differences between common dictionary 
elements across all tables. 
To access the Reports View in the Dictionary Diagrammer, press the Reports View button located on the Diagrammer 
Toolbar: 
 
This will open up a series of Summary Data Grid Views of key components of all tables in the active DCT: 
  
Regarding the column headers in the View: 
• 
CLICK and DRAG to reposition. 
• 
CLICK to sort by that column. 
• 
SHIFT + CLICK to add another column to the current sort. 
• 
CTRL + CLICK to remove a column from the active sort. 
  
Press the Print button on the Diagrammer toolbar to print the current View. 
  
 
Due to a variety of recent upgrades and improvements in the Dictionary Editor, you will need to reconvert your C6 
Dictionaries (DCTs) to the new C7 format. Please feel free to discard your previous C7 DCT versions. This is required for 
the proper operation of the new Reports View.

Dictionary Editor 
The Data Dictionary is the central repository information concerning your application's data. The Dictionary file--.DCT--
stores file names, file structures, file relations, file aliases, field names, lengths, and data types, field validity checks, field 
entry pictures, keys, indexes, plus much more such as status bar help messages by field and default prompt values by 
field. 
The Application Generator uses the Data Dictionary to generate source code, such as file declarations, which it places in 
the data section of the generated source code files. It also uses the dictionary to provide, for example, entry pictures when 
formatting entry dialogs for the end user. 
The menu commands available from within the Dictionary Editor are identical to the menu commands of the main IDE. 
Many dialog in the Dictionary Editor have Help buttons which you can press to view a help topic specifically about that 
dialog (the F1 key calls the same topic when the dialog is open). 
Note that some of the commands, most notably on the Project and Setup menus, do not specifically reference Dictionary 
Editor functions. Because the Project System and the Registries are always active, their menu commands are always 
available. 
Here are the keys sections of the Dictionary Editor:

New/Edit Column Properties Dialog 
  
 
  
The Column Properties dialog allows you to define columns and variables, and to set column or variable related options 
and attributes. 
All the Clarion language attributes that you can place on a column also apply to memory variables. There are only a few 
additional attributes that can only be placed on global or local memory variables. These are disabled when defining a 
column. 
The Dictionary Editor allows you to add the columns one after another, quickly. Each time you complete and close the 
Column Properties dialog for one column, another blank Column Properties dialog appears, ready for the next column. 
Press Cancel when the blank dialog appears after completing the last column, to return to the Column/Key Definition 
dialog. 
General 
Column Name 
To name the column, type a valid Clarion label in the Name prompt. Valid column names may vary slightly according to 
the file driver.  
Derived From 
Press the ellipsis button (...) to select another (parent) column in the dictionary from which to copy all column attributes, 
except the column name. The parent column may be any other column in the data dictionary, including global data, 
column pool, or file columns.  
If a field is derived from another field, then clicking the 
 button will take you to the derived field. 
All fields that have other fields derived from it now have a different icon in the tree display 
 so you can easily see 
"derived from" fields. 
Fields that have other fields derived from them have a new Derived Columns tab in their properties. You can also right-
click on these columns and select View Dependant Columns for a similar view. This is a tree showing all fields derived 
from the field. If a field in this tree will have child fields if there are fields derived from it. Fields in this view have either the 
normal field icon or a different one (ignore what it looks like at present). The alternate icon indicates that the field has the 
Freeze check box checked. 
You can double click on a field in this tree to go directly to its properties. 
When you indicate that a field is derived from another field you are now presented with a dialog allowing you to set how 
the Freeze check box is set. If you select the Always or Never options, you can change the setting later via the 
Tools/Options/Clarion/Dictionary Editor Options/Columns tab. 
  
Change in Behavior for Derived From 
In versions of Clarion prior to Clarion 7 when you changed a field that had other fields derived from it you had to manually 
apply the changes by either clicking on the Refresh button in the derived field or by selecting Edit/Distribute File. In 
Clarion 7 and later changes are automatically applied to derived fields that do not have freeze checked as soon as you 
save changes to a derived from field. 
Because of this behavioral change, when a dictionary is converted from C6 to C9, all fields that are derived from other 
fields have freeze checked. A message appears in the Dictionary Changes Pad to this effect, but each field is not listed 
separately. 
As the propagation is now automatic, the Freeze check box on Tables and Globals no longer has any meaning. So it has 
been removed.

You can no longer derive a field from itself. Any dictionaries that have this will have the derived from attribute removed. 
This change appears in the Dictionary Changes Pad. 
You can no longer have a field derived from another field with a different type. Any fields that have this will have their 
derived from attribute removed. This change appears in the Dictionary Changes Pad. Once a field is derived from 
another field, its data type fields are disabled. 
  
Description 
To add a text description, type it in the Description field. The description appears next to the column name in various 
dialogs.  You can optionally assign the description to the MSG attribute by choosing Setup Dictionary Options and 
checking the appropriate box.. 
 
Clarion's Wizards use this description when creating Browses, Forms, and Reports. 
Data Type 
To assign a column type, choose one from the Type drop down list. Clarion supports the following column types, which 
specify how the data will be stored on disk by the file driver, and accessed in memory by the application. These 
correspond to the Clarion variable types, plus memo and picture types. The types available vary according to the selected 
database driver. See Also: Variable Declaration Statements for a complete list of data types available. 
 
The Decimal type generally provides the best all around performance for mathematical calculations. The compiler 
optimizes the operation by multiplying values by powers of ten before processing; this greatly speeds up performance on 
systems without math coprocessors, at no cost in mathematical precision. See Also: BCD Operations and Procedures  
Base Type 
Specify the label of a user-defined datatype. The user-defined data type can be a GROUP, a QUEUE, or an object. See 
## TYPE.
For example: 
G1 GROUP,TYPE !a user-defined data type 
## S1  STRING(10)
## S2  STRING(10)
   END 
Use the Base type column to specify the G1 label so the Application Generator generates something like the following: 
MyTypeField G1 
Reference 
To create a reference variable, check the Reference box. A reference variable stores the memory address of another 
variable. This box is enabled only when defining memory variables  
Binary 
To specify that a MEMO field may hold binary data, check the Binary box. This is dependent on the file driver. This adds 
the BINARY attribute. 
Characters 
To assign a column length specify a number in the Chars field. 
Places 
To assign a set number of decimal places for a real number, specify a number in the Places field. 
Dimensions 
To declare the variable as an array, and to specify the array dimensions, type them in the Dimensions fields. You can 
specify up to four dimension sizes. This adds the DIM attribute.

Row Picture 
To specify the picture for a picture column, type it in the Record Picture field.  
Screen Picture 
To specify a screen picture , type it in the Screen Picture field.  
"Lock" icon 
To lock the screen picture, which specifies that it may not be changed if the column type is changed, press the "Lock" icon 
next to the Screen Picture field. 
Prompt Text 
To specify the default prompt string, type it in the Prompt Text field. The Application Generator uses this for controls 
which display an on screen prompt. 
Column Heading 
To specify the default column title, type it in the Column Heading field. The Application Generator uses this for reports. 
Freeze 
Check this box to prevent column attribute refresh from the parent column. Use the Derived From field above to set the 
parent column. See also the Refresh Column, Refresh Table, Refresh Dictionary, and Distribute Column menu 
commands. 
Attributes 
Case 
To specify the case attribute for controls referencing the column, choose from the Normal, Capitals or Uppercase radio 
buttons, in the Case group box. The Application Generator adds the CAP or UPR attributes.  
Typing Mode 
To specify the default typing mode attribute for controls referencing the column, choose from the Insert, Overwrite or As 
Is radio buttons in the Typing Mode group box. The Application Generator adds the INS or OVR attributes. 
  
Flags 
Immediate 
To specify immediate event notification for controls referencing the column, check the Immediate box. The Application 
Generator adds the IMM attribute. 
Password 
To specify the data non-display attribute for controls referencing the column, check the Password box. The Application 
Generator adds the PASSWORD attribute. When an end user types in an entry control referencing this column, the 
characters typed do not appear on screen. 
Read only 
To specify the display only attribute for controls referencing the column, check the Read only box. The Application 
Generator adds the READONLY attribute. 
Justification 
To specify justification for controls referencing the column, select from the Alignment drop down list. The Application 
Generator adds the LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER or DECIMAL attribute.  
Offset 
To specify an indentation amount for controls referencing the column, specify a number in the Indent field. The 
Application Generator uses this setting as the parameter for the LEFT or RIGHT attribute. The measurement unit depends 
on the default measurement unit for the window in which a control referencing the column resides.  
  
Initial Value 
To specify a default value for the column, type it in the Initial Value field. Specifying an initial value for a database column 
generates an assignment statement. 
 A literal character value enclosed in single quotes generates: 
STATE:Code = 'FL' 


---

IDE Reference 
171 
 For numeric data types, a number without quotes generates: 
CUS:CreditLine = 1000 
 The label of a global variable or a local variable that is visible to the procedure generates: 
USER:Preference = MyGlobalPreference 
 A function generates: 
INV:Date = TODAY() 
Specifying an initial value for a global, module, or local memory variable generates a data declaration statement. 
 
Functions and variables are valid initial values for database columns, but not for global, module, or local memory 
variables! Use single quotes to specify literal values for database columns, but no quotes are needed for memory 
variables. 
 A literal character value without quotes generates: 
MyString STRING('LITERAL') 
 for numeric data types, a number without quotes generates: 
MyNumber LONG(100) 
 
Initial Value literals cannot be used for STRING types greater than 1023. Use an embed point to prime values greater 
than this length.  
  
External Name 
To specify an external name for the column, type it in the External Name field. This covers cases where the column label 
within the program is different than the name of the column in the data file; for example, you may be accessing a column 
through an ODBC connection to a database which allows column names longer than the maximum for a Clarion label. 
Place the name of the column as it exists in the data table here. See Also: ODBC Accelerator Driver  
Initialization 
(Application Generator Only) Check the Do not Initialize box to place the AUTO attribute on the data element defined. 
This means that the compiler will not initialize the memory area that is reserved for this data element, and it is the 
programmer’s responsibility to do so. 
Place Over 
To declare the column as an overlay, select another column name from the drop down list. This allows the current column 
to redefine the other column's location in memory. The Application Generator adds the OVER attribute. 
Storage Class 
Check box choices are available here based on the scope of where the variable is defined (global, module, or local). By 
default, a local variable is allocated from stack memory, which means the variable is reallocated for each new instance of 
the procedure. By default, global or module data is implicitly static. 
## STATIC
The variable is allocated static memory instead of stack memory, which makes the variable "persistent" from one 
instance of the procedure to the next. 
## THREAD
The variable is allocated static memory separately for each execution thread in the program. Thus the value of the 
variable depends on which thread is executing. 


---

IDE Reference 
172 
Allocation 
Check box choices are available here based on the scope of where the variable is defined (EXE or DLL). By default, a 
variable is allocated memory in the default program. 
EXTERNAL adds the EXTERNAL attribute. 
Specifies the variable is defined in an external library, and therefore is allocated no memory by this program. 
DLL adds EXTERNAL and DLL (dll_mode). 
Specifies the variable is defined externally in a DLL. dll_mode is a switch indicating whether the DLL attribute is 
active or not. The DLL attribute is required for EXTERNAL variables in 32-bit applications. 
Comments 
Allows you to enter a text description describing the column. The description is solely for your convenience, and has no 
effect on the application. It is useful for situations in which other programmers may pick up your code later, or for when 
you expect to return to the project after a long period of time since you last looked at it. 
The Comments tab also contains read-only information about the selected dictionary element. It includes the date that it 
was created and llast modified, version number, and user rights to the target element. 
Options 
Do Not Auto-Populate This Column 
Directs the wizards to skip this column when creating Form, Browse or Report procedures. 
Population Order 
Specifies the order in which the wizards populate columns. Choose Normal, First, or Last from the drop down list. 
Wizards populate in this order: all Columns specified as First, then all Columns specified as Normal, and finally all 
Columns specified as Last. 
Form Tab 
Specifies the TAB onto which the wizards populate the column. Type the Caption for the TAB or select one you have 
previously created from the drop down list. This allows you to direct the wizard to group columns in the manner you want. 
Add Extra Vertical Space Before Column Controls on Form Procedures 
Check this box to direct the wizards to add vertical space between this column's control and the one populated above it. 
User Options 
The IDE supports 3rd party pre-defined DCT options. These options are stored in .dctopt files. 
The dctopt file is an XML file with a schema of dctopt.xsd.  
Any dctopt file in <clarion>/data/DictionaryOptions or <userdata>\SoftVelocity\Clarion\7.0\DictionaryOptions directories 
will be read by the IDE. 
The default for SoftVelocity is <Clarion Root>\data\DictionaryOptions\SoftVelocity.dctopt. 
The IDE will also automatically detect changes in these files and update the list of available options 
The text typed into this column is available to any Utility Templates that process this file in the %FieldUserOptions symbol. 
The individual Utility Templates determine the proper syntax for these user options. See also EXTRACT and 
%FieldUserOptions in the Template Language Reference. 
The maximum length for any individual option is 4096 characters. 
To add a new entry, press the Insert button in the Options toolbar. In the subsequent dialog, you have four choices: Bool, 
String, Integer or Predefined. Bool is for Boolean type expressions, such as On or Off, True or False, etc. 
If you choose String, the value has an ellipsis button to open a text window. This allows you to enter a string value. 
If you select Integer, the user-defined option will be a numeric value. 
Choose Predefined to get a property that is already defined. This is used to set pre-defined properties for use later. A 
drop list is provided allow you to choose from the list. Selecting a property from this list not only adds the property but also 
activates it for use. Follow the instructions provided with your add-on template set.

Help 
Help ID 
To specify a help ID for controls referencing the column, specify a help topic in the HLP field. The Application Generator 
adds the HLP attribute. 
Message 
To specify a status bar message for controls referencing the column, type the message in the MSG field. The Application 
Generator adds the MSG attribute. When the control referencing the column has focus, the text appears on the status bar, 
provided the window in which the control appears has one. 
Tool Tip 
To specify a popup message for controls referencing the column, type the message in the Tool Tip field. When the cursor 
is idle over the control referencing the column, the message appears immediately below the cursor in a popup box. The 
Application Generator adds the TIP attribute. 
Validity Checks 
Choose a validation option in this dialog. The Application Generator uses the information when creating and maintaining 
controls. When the user completes the field and shifts focus to another control, the application will sound a warning beep 
and set focus back to the control if the data is not valid. 
Allow Null 
Check this box to allow a true NULL value to exist in the target column. 
No Checks 
Specifies no validation. This is the default. 
 
Some validation can still occur, depending on the control you use to display the data, and the attributes of the control. For 
example, an ENTRY control with the REQ attribute automatically enforces a non-blank entry. 
Choices 
Type the choices to display in the format "Choice1|Choice2|Choice3." Separate the choices with a pipe (|) character 
(usually SHIFT+\). The Application Generator adds the FROM attribute to SPIN, LIST, and COMBO controls, or adds text 
to RADIO controls (see the Language Reference). 
Values 
Type the value to assign when the end user selects the corresponding choice. Type the values in the format 
"value1|value2|value3." Separate the values with a pipe (|) character (usually SHIFT+\). The Application Generator adds 
the VALUE attribute to RADIO controls (see the Language Reference). 
Must be in Numeric Range 
Specifies the entry must fall within a numeric range. You may specify a minimum value, a maximum value, or both. The 
Application Generator generates code to enforce the range you specify, and adds the RANGE attribute to SPIN controls 
(see the Language Reference). 
Lowest 
Check this box to set a minimum value, then enter the value in the corresponding spin box. Clear the box to specify no 
minimum value. 
Highest 
Check this box to set a maximum value, then enter the value in the corresponding spin box. Clear the box to specify no 
maximum value. 
By entering only a lowest, or only a highest value, you can specify an open ended range. 
Must be True or False 
Specifies a Boolean entry (yes/no, true/false, off/on). The Data Dictionary Window Control defaults to CHECK. 
True Value 
Type the value to assign when the end user checks the CHECK control. The Application Generator adds the VALUE 
attribute to the CHECK control (see the Language Reference). 


---

IDE Reference 
174 
False Value 
Type the value to assign when the end user clears the CHECK control. The Application Generator adds the VALUE 
attribute to the CHECK control (see the Language Reference). 
  
 
The Application Generator does not generate code to enforce true/false entries because, in Clarion, all entries evaluate as 
either true or false. This selection affects the default window control in the Data Dictionary and applies the VALUE 
attribute if the control is a CHECK. 
Must be in Table 
Specifies the value must match a column in a table. This option is enabled only if you previously related another table or 
tables. See Adding or Modifying Relationships in this chapter. 
Table Label 
Select the lookup table from the list of related tables. The Application Generator generates code to make sure the entered 
value is in the selected lookup table. 
  
 
Use the FileDrop or FileDropCombo control template in your application to provide a same window pick list for the end 
user, or use the Actions tab for an ENTRY control to provide a separate window pick list. 
Must be in List 
Specifies the value must match one of the specified choices. The choices are displayed with a SPIN, LIST, COMBO, or 
RADIO control. 
Choices 
Type the choices to display in the format "Choice1|Choice2|Choice3." Separate the choices with a pipe (|) character 
(usually SHIFT+\). The Application Generator adds the FROM attribute to SPIN, LIST, and COMBO controls, or adds text 
to RADIO controls (see the Language Reference). 
Values 
Type the value to assign when the end user selects the corresponding choice. Type the values in the format 
"value1|value2|value3." Separate the values with a pipe (|) character (usually SHIFT+\). The Application Generator adds 
the VALUE attribute to RADIO controls (see the Language Reference). 
  
 
The Application Generator does not generate code to enforce Must be in List entries. This selection affects the default 
window control in the Data Dictionary and applies the FROM and VALUE attributes. 
Window 
To pre-format a window control referencing the current field, select the Screen Controls tab, then specify the options in 
this dialog. 
 
By choosing the properties for a control at this time, you can save time later. Every application you generate from the 
dictionary, and every procedure in the application will automatically format the control the way you want it. If you don't 
format it here, and if the control requires custom formatting, you will have to custom format it for each procedure and 
application later. 
Select either the prompt or entry field from the Window Controls list, then press the Properties button. The prompt is the 
label which appears next to the control. The entry field is the actual control which accepts user input. 
Window Controls 
In most cases, this list box will show an ENTRY and PROMPT control for the column. Select the control to preformat.

columns in the FILE as the parents of derived columns. See Derived From in 
the Column Properties dialog. Also available from the right-click menu. 
Add Alias 
Adds a new alias to the active dictionary. An alias creates a second 
reference for a table without duplicating the file on disk. You can add an alias 
for a table only if it is already on the Dictionary list, and a Full Path Name 
exists for the active table. Also available from the right-click menu. 
Add Global 
The structure represents a group of global data declarations. The Application 
Generator generates a global data declaration for each column in the 
structure. You can use the global columns as the parents of derived 
columns. See Derived From in the Column Properties dialog. This option 
enables the Generate Last checkbox which causes these declarations to 
follow declarations made for global variables defined in the .APP. Also 
available from the right-click menu. 
Add Pool 
The structure represents a Column Pool. The Application Generator 
generates no code for this structure. You can use the columns in the pool as 
the parents of derived columns. See Derived From in the Column Properties 
dialog. Also available from the right-click menu. 
Add Table Category 
Add a table category,to allow powerful grouping features to allow subset 
views of the tables in the Dictionary. Not implemented in this release. 
Import Tables 
From this option you can import a single table, multiple tables, or tables from 
another dictionary, dependant on the type of driver selected in the Table 
Import Dialog.

the new C7 XML based format (DCTX). 
You can also export the active dictionary contents to the C7 XML-based 
DCTX format. 
  
Right Click Menu 
Don’t forget the right click popup menu. In addition to the items already mentioned above, the following choices are 
available: 
Generate 
Conversion 
Program 
If you right-click on any table in the DCT explorer, you can create a 
conversion program using one of three conversion sources; a data file on 
disk, another file structure in the current dictionary, or another file 
structure in another dictionary. 
The next submenu determines the generated code base used for the 
conversion program. If you have both Clarion for Windows and 
Clarion.NET installed in the same IDE, this turns into a menu with 2 
submenus "using Clarion for Windows" and "using Clarion#" allowing for 
export of compatible data types to each platforms. This menu item will 
not appear for SQL tables as data conversion is handled by the server 
and the generated program is not appropriate to run against an SQL 
database. The selected table that you right-click on is the target table. 
After optionally renaming or changing the default folder, a second dialog 
is presented that prompts you to select the source or original table to 
convert. 
 
After the program is generated, you will be presented with a dialog option 
to load the newly generated project into the IDE. In the 
Tools/Options/Clarion/Dictionary Editor Options/General tab: there is a 
Load Conversion Project option. After a conversion program is 
generated you can optionally load the project. You can set this to always 
load the project, never load the project or ask each time a conversion 
program is generated. The default is to ask.

The display options in this dialog also affect the appearance of the Data/Tables Pad. 
General 
Initial Version Text 
Sets the text to display to set the version of the dictionary. When 
you first create a dictionary it has an initial version with a name 
equal to what you set in that field. During the lifetime of the 
dictionary you can create new versions. Each version is a marker 
that is used in the Audit details of an object. If you go to the Audit 
tab of any object in the dictionary you will see a Version against 
the Created and Modified details. This indicates which version of 
the dictionary the object was created in and in with version it was 
last changed. 
  
Add a Comment to the 
Dictionary when a new 
version is created 
  
Check this option to automatically add a comment to the 
Dictionary every time the version is updated.

Enforce Clarion# name 
restrictions 
By default this is on (checked). When checked, the dictionary 
editor will not allow you to create labels that are not valid in 
Clarion#. For example. AS is an illegal label, but legal in Clarion 
for Windows. If you do not want to worry about Clarion# 
restrictions you can uncheck this box. 
  
If Clarion# restrictions are enabled and you load a dictionary into 
the editor that has a label that violates the Clarion# naming 
restrictions the editor will automatically rename the object to 
ObjectType_OldLabel, where ObjectType is a Table, Alias, 
Global, Pool, Key or Column. If the object is a Key or a Column 
with no external name, the external name is set to the old label. 
  
For example, "AS STRING(10)" will be converted to  
  
"Column_AS STRING(10),NAME('AS') 
  
Any such change will appear in the Dictionary Changes pad.

Dictionary Properties Dialog 
Displays information about the current data dictionary, including creation, modification dates, and a text description. 
Audit 
Created 
The original file creation date. 
Last Modified The most recent modification date. See Also: Version  Checkpoint; Version  
Revert.  
  
Password 
Password options are now located in the Users section of the Dictionary. 
Versions 
The Dictionary Editor automatically places an internal version number in your dictionary file. A new dictionary begins with 
version 1.0. You can see the version number/revision number on the caption bar of the Dictionary Properties dialog. This 
dialog also displays the original creation data and time, and the last modified date and time. 
You can do this by going to the Dictionary Properties and selecting the Versions tab. From there you can add a new 
version.  
When you add a version the existing dictionary is backed up to dictionaryName.x.dct where x is the old version number. 
Optionally a comment is added to the dictionary's comments. The default format of this comment is "**** Version {version} 
added", where {version} is replaced with the version number for the new version.  
What comment is added or if a comment is added is controlled in the Tools/Options/Clarion/Dictionary Editor 
Options/General section. 
To revert to an earlier version, you can simply rename dict.1.dct to dict.dct ,and you will go back to version 1. 
  
Comments 
Allows you to enter a text description describing the dictionary. The description is solely for your convenience, and has no 
effect on the application. It is useful for situations in which other programmers may pick up your code later, or for when 
you expect to return to the project after a long period of time since you last looked at it. 
Options 
User Options 
The IDE supports 3rd party pre-defined DCT options. These options are stored in .dctopt files. 
The dctopt file is an XML file with a schema of dctopt.xsd.  
Any dctopt file in <clarion>/data/DictionaryOptions or <userdata>\SoftVelocity\Clarion\7.0\DictionaryOptions directories 
will be read by the IDE.  
The IDE will also automatically detect changes in these files and update the list of available options 
The default for SoftVelocity is <Clarion Root>\data\DictionaryOptions\SoftVelocity.dctopt. 
  
The text typed into this field is available to any Utility Templates that process this table in the %DictionaryToolOptions 
symbol. The individual Utility Templates determine the proper syntax for these user options. See also EXTRACT and 
%DictionaryToolOptions in the Template Language Reference. 
To add a new entry, press the Insert button in the Options toolbar. In the subsequent dialog, you have four choices: Bool, 
String, Integer or Predefined. Bool is for Boolean type expressions, such as On or Off, True or False, etc.

If you choose String, the value has an ellipsis button to open a text window. This allows you to enter a string value. The 
maximum length for any option is 4096 characters. 
If you select Integer, the user-defined option will be a numeric value. 
Choose Predefined to get a property that is already defined. This is used to set pre-defined properties for use later. A 
drop list is provided allow you to choose from the list. Selecting a property from this list not only adds the property but also 
activates it for use

Dictionary Triggers 
The Triggers interface of the Dictionary Editor allows you to enter Clarion source that can be applied before or after any 
data operation is performed on a selected table. 
 
In the Dictionary Explorer, triggers attached to any table are indicated by the following special icon: 
 
A trigger can include any Clarion language statement to execute as a unit and can also invoke procedures defined in your 
application. However, procedures and triggers differ in the way that they are invoked. A procedure is explicitly executed by 
a user, application, or trigger. Triggers (one or more) are implicitly fired (executed) by the supported database when a 
triggering ADD, APPEND, PUT, DELETE, GET, NEXT, PREVIOUS, or CREATE statement is issued, no matter which 
user is connected or which application is being used. 
A Data button is also available on this window. The data elements that you add here apply to all trigger types created for 
the selected table.  
  
Uses of Triggers 
Triggers can supplement the standard capabilities of a database to provide a highly customized database management 
system. For example, a trigger can restrict operations against a table to those issued during regular business hours. A 
trigger could also restrict operations to occur only at certain times during weekdays. Other uses for triggers are to  
• 
automatically generate derived column values  
• 
prevent invalid transactions  
• 
enforce referential integrity across nodes in a distributed database  
• 
enforce complex business rules  
• 
provide transparent event logging  
• 
maintain synchronous table replicates  
• 
gather statistics on table access  
• 
store complex computed and conditional fields that are table related in one location 
• 
use SQL to create a table structure 
Triggers are an extremely powerful tool, but you need to spend some time planning the use of triggers. Consider that 
when a trigger is executed, if your trigger code accesses another table(s) that a table access statement can cause 
execution of another trigger(s).

Dictionary Entity Browser 
The Dictionary Entity Browser is a tree control that provides a complete view of all elelemnts of your dictionary. Click on 
any element to display the detail property dialog of the selected element. 
This dialog appears as a middle pane within the Dictionary Editor.  
Press the Add button in the toolbar to add Columns, Keys, Relations, Aliases, and Triggers from this view. 
A splitter control separates the Entity Browser from the Properties windows. Drag the splitter bar at the bottom or top to 
resize, or click on the middle splitter button to hide or unhide the Browser. 
 
The Dictionary Editor allows you to have multiple tables open at the same time. You can make changes to entities within a 
table. Pressing the Save button within the Entity browser allows you to save the changes to that entity. However, you 
have the chance to later rollback all your changes by closing the dictionary editor without saving. 
  
So the Save button in the entity editor allows you to save the changes you have made, but still have the option to discard 
those changes. The Save button on the main IDE toolbar saves the dictionary. At that stage you cannot revert your 
changes.

blank dialog appears after completing the last key, to return to the Column/Key Definition dialog. 
General 
Label 
To specify a Clarion label for the key, type a valid Clarion label in this field. 
 
Remember that you cannot give a key the same name as one of the fields within the RECORD. One common convention 
is to use the field name plus the word "key," as in LastNameKey. 
Description 
To place a text description for the key in the Data Dictionary, type it in this field. The description appears in dialogs such 
as the File Definition dialog. If you anticipate using many keys for your application, we recommend filling in this field. 
 
Clarion's Wizards use this description when creating Browses, Forms, and Reports. 
External Name 
To specify a DOS filename for an external key, type a valid DOS filename in this field. 
Type 
To specify a record key, static index file, dynamic index file or Order, choose an option button in the Type group. The 
Static Index and Dynamic Index options are disabled when the Require Unique Value box on the Attributes tab is 
checked, because indexes allow duplicates. Order adds a sort order definition to a template symbol (%ORDER) in a 
similar manner as a KEY without affecting the file declaration.  
Note: Orders specified in a dictionary are not yet supported in the included templates. Some third party templates may 
use this option. 
Attributes 
Require Unique Value 
To disallow multiple records with duplicate values in their keys, check this box. This option is valid only for keys, and is 
disabled for indexes. 
Primary Key 
To establish the current key as the Primary key, mark this checkbox. The Application Generator adds the PRIMARY 
attribute. This may be required for certain file drivers. 
The primary key must be unique and exclude nulls.

New/Edit Relationship Properties Dialog 
 
Click on a TAB to see its help 
Set relationships between files in this dialog. The relationships appear in the Related Files list on the Dictionary dialog, 
for the currently selected file. When completing this dialog, work from the top down. Start with the Relationship for 
selected file group box: 
General 
Type 
Set the relationship type by choosing 1:Many or Many:1 from the drop down list. 
Key 
Depending on the relationship type selected, choose a primary or foreign key from the drop down list. The choices in the 
drop down are the keys previously defined for the currently selected file. 
Depending on the relationship type you choose for the selected file, the label of the next group box is Parent or Child 
(respective to 1:Many or Many:1): 
Related File 
Choose another file from the dictionary to relate to the selected file. 
Key 
Depending the relationship type you choose for the selected file, the label for this drop down box will be either Primary or 
Foreign. Select a previously defined key for the related file from the drop down box. 
Field Mapping 
This group box displays two lists, each showing a key, and the field in the related file which "maps" to it. If the key field 
names of each file match each other, then just press the Map by Name button (below), and Dictionary Editor will 
automatically link the fields. If they do not, double click on each item in the list boxes, then select a field from the related 
file that links to the key, in the Select a Field dialog. 
Map By Name 
Automatically defines links based on similarly named fields in each data file. 
Map By Order 
Automatically defines links based on the order in which fields are defined in each data file.  
 
Alternatively, you can map each field manually by double-clicking the field name in the Field Mapping list. 
  
After choosing all other options, set the options in the Referential Integrity Constraints group box. The Application 
Generator automatically generates the code that enforces your selections. 
Referential Integrity requires that a foreign key cannot contain any value which has no match in the primary key. This 
raises potential problems when the end user wishes to change or delete the primary key record. 
The On Update and On Delete drop down boxes each offer the following choices: 
No Action 
Instructs the Application Generator not to generate any code to maintain referential integrity. 


---

IDE Reference 
191 
Restrict 
Instructs the Application Generator to disallow the user from deleting an entry, if the value is used in a foreign key. For 
example, if the user attempts to change a primary key value, the generated code attempts to check for a related record 
with the new value, changes it back if necessary, then loops back to the entry dialog so that the user can enter another 
value. 
Cascade 
Instructs the Application Generator to update or delete the foreign key record. For example, if the user changes a primary 
key value, the generated code changes the values in the foreign key that referenced the primary key. If the user deletes a 
primary key value, the code deletes the foreign key value, too. 
Clear 
Instructs the Application Generator to change the value in the foreign key to blank or zero. 
 
The following server settings have the same effect as the No Action setting (no code is generated); however, they can 
provide an indication that RI is enforced elsewhere, and their values can be used to trigger template generated scripts for 
the server. 
Restrict (Server) 
Tells the Application Generator that the back-end server will prevent the user from deleting or changing an entry if the 
value is used in a foreign key. 
Cascade (Server) 
Tells the Application Generator that the back-end server will update or delete the foreign key record. 
Clear (Server) 
Tells the Application Generator that the back-end server will set the foreign key to null or zero. 
Comments 
Allows you to enter a text description describing the relationship. The description is solely for your convenience, and has

Allows you to enter a text description describing the alias. The description is solely for your convenience, and has no 
effect on the application. It is useful for situations in which other programmers may pick up your code later, or for when 
you expect to return to the project after a long period of time since you last looked at it. 
Options 
Do Not Auto-Populate This Aliased Table 
Directs the wizards to skip the Aliased Table when creating primary Browse procedures or Report procedures. 
User Options User Options are provided to enable you to provide information to be used by a third-party template set. 
User Options are comma delimited, that is, each entry is separated by a comma.  
Follow the instructions provided with your add-on template set. 
See Also:     Using Wizard Options  
A table alias provides several advantages, at the cost of some system overhead: 
 
It allows you to set multiple relationships between tables. 
Strict relational database theoreticians state a table may only have a single relational link to another table at a time. 
Aliases allow you to "legally" work around this limitation. See Also: How to Design Your Dictionary and Database  
 
It allows a second table buffer for the same table. 
You could use this for a second table browse, as well as entry forms and other items for each. This is particularly useful 
for an MDI application. 
 
On the negative side, the second table buffer takes up additional memory and resources. 
Any table driver utilizing external key files requires additional file handles for each alias. For example, a table with three 
external keys and three aliases requires sixteen file handles: one each for the "first" data table and its three keys, and an 
additional four for each of the aliases. When using aliases, we recommend choosing a database driver that stores keys 
internally, such as TopSpeed or Btrieve. 
 
When using aliases, you must open the table in Share mode. 
To modify the alias properties at a later time, highlight the table name on the Dictionary dialog list, then either double-
click or press the Properties button. 
You can edit the columns and keys for the Alias by pressing the Columns/Keys button. The Columns/Key Definition 
dialog lists the columns and keys for the original table; any changes you make will update the originals.

New/Edit Table Properties Dialog 
This dialog allows you to add a new data table to the list and choose its database driver. 
Once the table appears on the list, you may declare columns, keys, set relationships, and other properties for the data 
table. Using the data from this dialog, the Application Generator will write the FILE structure declaration. 
To modify the table properties at a later time, highlight the table name on the Dictionary dialog list, then either DOUBLE-
CLICK or press the Properties button. 
 
General 
Label 
Type a data table name, as you wish to refer to it in your code. This serves as the label for the Clarion FILE structure. 
Specify a valid Clarion label--Clarion will automatically truncate the name if necessary. You may also specify a completely 
different name for the DOS file--see Full Pathname, below. See Also: Declaration and Statement Labels. 
Description 
Enter a string description for the table. Clarion automatically displays the descriptions in certain dialogs, allowing you to 
quickly recognize the table contents.  
Prefix 
As you enter the data table Name, Clarion automatically extracts the first three letters to use as a label prefix when 
referring to the table. Optionally specify up to 14 characters of your choice in this field. This supplies the parameter for the 
PRE attribute. 
The prefix allows your application to distinguish between similar variable names occurring in different data structures. A 
column called Invoice may exist in one data table called Orders and another called Sales. By establishing a unique prefix 
for Orders (ORD) and Sales (SAL), the application may refer to columns as ORD:INVOICE and SAL:INVOICE. 
Driver 
Specify the database type. This supplies the first parameter for the DRIVER attribute. When using the Application 
Generator, Clarion automatically links in the correct database driver library. See Database Drivers for a discussion of the 
relative advantages of each driver. You can specify the default driver by choosing Setup Dictionary Options. 
Remember that individual database drivers may vary in their support of some of the attributes which you add to the FILE 
structure in this dialog box. 
Driver Options 
Optionally type a string for the second parameter of the DRIVER attribute. This conveys additional instructions to the 
database driver and corresponds to the second parameter for the DRIVER attribute, also known as a "driver string." 
Database Drivers contains additional information. This supplies the second parameter for the DRIVER attribute.  
Owner Name 
Optionally type a string containing the password for access to the table. This is dependent on the database system. This 
adds the OWNER attribute to the FILE statement.  
You may also check the Encrypt box (below) which adds the ENCRYPT attribute. Encrypting the table means that only 
your application will be able to read the table. It does not mean that it automatically prompts the end user for a password. 
The end user, however, may not access the data with any other table viewer. 
When using the ODBC driver, type the data source name, user ID, and password, separated by commas, in this field. 
Full Path Name 
Type either the path, or a fully qualified file name for the data table. If you leave the file name out, Clarion automatically 
uses the first eight letters of the name entered in the Name field. You may also omit the table extension--Clarion will 
supply the correct extension depending on the database driver chosen. This supplies the parameter for the NAME 
attribute. 
When using the TopSpeed driver, if you wish to store multiple tables in a single physical file, separate the file and table 
names with "\!," as in INVOICE\!ORDERS. This refers to the ORDERS table in the INVOICE.TPS file.  
See Also: TopSpeed Database Driver

IDE Reference

When using an ODBC driver to define a FILE such as Microsoft Access, which can store multiple tables in a single file, 
place the table name in this field. Typically, the name of the physical file which includes the table is listed in the ODBC.INI 
file; the ODBC driver manager provides this information to the driver. 
 
To specify a variable name for the actual file name, place it in this field, and prefix the variable name with an exclamation 
point (!). 
Create 
Optionally specify that the application should create the data table if it does not exist at runtime. This adds the CREATE 
attribute to the FILE statement. 
Reclaim 
This option is dependent upon the database driver. It specifies that the application reuse file space formerly taken up by 
deleted records. Otherwise, the application adds new records to the end of the table. This adds the RECLAIM attribute to 
the FILE statement. 
Encrypt 
Optionally turn on table encryption. You must also specify an Owner Name (see above). This adds the ENCRYPT 
attribute to the FILE statement. 
Threaded 
Optionally specify that each execution thread in your application that uses this table allocates memory for its own separate 
record buffer. This is typically for use in multiple document applications, and improves table handling. The Clarion default 
templates automatically add the THREAD attribute on each FILE structure. 
OEM 
Specifies string data is converted from OEM ASCII to ANSI when read from disk and ANSI to OEM ASCII before writing to 
disk. This adds the OEM attribute to the table definition. 
Bindable 
Optionally specify that all variables in the RECORD structure are available for use in dynamic expressions at runtime. The 
compiler will allocate memory to hold the full Prefix:Name for each variable, instead of using its own internal reference for 
each variable. Therefore the BINDABLE attribute increases the amount of memory necessary for the application. 
Comments 
Allows you to enter a text description describing the table. The description is solely for your convenience, and has no 
effect on the application. It is useful for situations in which other programmers may pick up your code later, or for when 
you expect to return to the project after a long period of time since you last looked at it. 
The Comments tab also contains read-only information about the selected dictionary element. It includes the date that it 
was created and llast modified, version number, and user rights to the target element. 
Options 
Do Not Auto-Populate This Table 
Directs the wizards to skip this table when creating primary Browse procedures or Report procedures. 
User Options 
The IDE supports 3rd party pre-defined DCT options. These options are stored in .dctopt files. 
The dctopt file is an XML file with a schema of dctopt.xsd.  
Any dctopt file in <clarion>/data/DictionaryOptions or <userdata>\SoftVelocity\Clarion\7.0\DictionaryOptions directories 
will be read by the IDE.  
The default for SoftVelocity is <Clarion Root>\data\DictionaryOptions\SoftVelocity.dctopt. 
The IDE will also automatically detect changes in these files and update the list of available options 
The text typed into this field is available to any Utility Templates that process this table in the %FileUserOptions symbol. 
The individual Utility Templates determine the proper syntax for these user options. See also %FileUserOptions in the 
Template Language Reference.

Users Dialog 
The Dictionary Users dialog is opened by the Users button on the DCT Explorer toolbar. 
The default user is Administrator. This is the primary or master user of the DCT. Press the Change button, and optionally 
add a password to allow access to this DCT. 
You can add multiple users to the dictionary. Users have either read-only or read/write access. If a user has read-only 
access, they cannot see which other users have access to the dictionary. Users cannot be deleted if they have touched 
anything in a dictionary. If you attempt to delete a user who has touched the dictionary, you will get a list of all items they 
have touched. 
Summary of User Rules: 
• 
The 1st (default) user is the master user, and can not be deleted, but it can be renamed. 
• 
Any user with write access can create a new user. 
• 
Any user with write access can delete any other users except for the master user 
• 
Users CAN NOT be deleted if they have created any item in the dictionary. 
• 
Users CAN NOT be deleted if they were the last user to modify anything in the dictionary. 
• 
Users marked "read-only" cannot access the user’s information.

Dictionary Synchronizer 
 
Synchronizer Wizard Overview 
(Enterprise Edition Only) 
The Dictionary Synchronizer synchronizes the open Clarion data dictionary with another Clarion data dictionary (*.DCT), a 
Clarion text dictionary (*.TXD), or a non-Clarion database such as ORACLE, MSSQL, or Btrieve. 
  
What the Synchronizer Does 
Generally speaking, the Dictionary Synchronizer: 
• 
automates the conversion of existing data between different versions of your software; 
• 
automates the synchronization, in either direction, of the "master" data dictionary or database with other project 
data dictionaries and databases; 
• 
creates a complete Clarion data dictionary, including relationships, from an existing database (SQL, Btrieve, etc.) 
in a single pass. 
More specifically, the Dictionary Synchronizer 
• 
compares a Clarion data dictionary with another Clarion data dictionary or with a database (SQL or Btrieve) to 
identify any differences between them, 
• 
resolves the differences (with your interactive input, or according to a prior synchronization) by proposing changes 
to the target dictionary or database, 
• 
validates the proposed changes, 
• 
backs up the target dictionary or (non-SQL) database, 
• 
implements the proposed changes directly to the target dictionary (.dct, .txd, or .ddf), or generates an SQL script 
to implement the changes to the SQL database, 
• 
generates an SQL script or Clarion program to implement the proposed changes to any existing data, 
• 
saves pertinent information about the process for subsequent reuse. 
This functionality aids team development by automating the synchronization, in either direction, of the "master" dictionary 
or database with other project dictionaries and databases. It lets you easily convert or upgrade existing data to higher or 
later versions of your software, which is a major benefit to both team and individual developers. Finally, the power of 
Dictionary Synchronizer applies not only to Clarion data dictionaries, but also to non-Clarion file systems and databases 
such as Oracle, MSSQL, Scalable SQL, Btrieve, etc., so you can create complete Clarion data dictionaries froma existing 
databases in a single pass. 
Synchronizer Servers 
The Dictionary Synchronizer uses Synchronizer Servers to access data dictionaries and databases. A Synchronizer 
Server is a .dll that communicates with a database or file system such as ORACLE, MSSQL, Btrieve, etc. 
Generally speaking, the Synchronizer Server does two things:  
1. During the dictionary comparison stage, it queries the dictionary or database and collects a complete, current 
description of the database's files or tables, keys, views, relationships, objects and properties. 
2. During the implementation stage, it generates and optionally executes the programs and database commands 
necessary to carry out any proposed changes, including converting existing SQL data. 
There is a built in Synchronizer Server for Clarion data dictionaries, plus several separate Synchronizer Servers for SQL 
and Btrieve databases. The Clarion Dictionary server handles all Clarion data dictionaries (regardless of the file driver), 
and need not be registered. 


---

IDE Reference 
212 
To register a Synchronizer Server, simply register the corresponding file driver with the Database Driver Registry. See 
Clarion's Development Environment—Database Driver Registry in the User's Guide for more information. 
Running the Synchronizer 
To run the Dictionary Synchronizer, first, be sure to register the appropriate database driver (see Synchronizer Servers for 
more information). Next, open your Clarion data dictionary, then press the Synchronize button. This starts the 
Synchronizer Wizard which leads you step-by-step through the synchronization process. The process requires that you 
• 
identify the other dictionary or database with which to synchronize, 
• 
specify the direction of synchronization (identify source and target), 
• 
tell the synchronizer what to synchronize (all files or some subset of files), 
• 
tell the synchronizer how to match files, fields, keys, and relationships (by name, by order, manually, or the same 
as the last time you synchronized these two dictionaries), 
• 
tell the synchronizer how to resolve differences between the dictionaries (copy, delete, ignore, etc.). 
 
The Dictionary Synchronizer does not backup data. We strongly recommend backing up your data prior to any conversion 
or synchronization.

Synchronizer Wizard - Synchronize With 
The Dictionary Synchronizer uses Synchronizer Servers to access data dictionaries and databases. A Synchronizer 
Server is a .dll that communicates with a database or file system such as ORACLE, MSSQL, Btrieve, etc. 
There is a built in Synchronizer Server for Clarion data dictionaries, plus several separate Synchronizer Servers for SQL

and need not be registered. 
To register a Synchronizer Server, simply register the corresponding file driver with the Database Driver Registry. See 
Clarion's Development Environment—Database Driver Registry in the User's Guide for more information. 
This window is used with multiple functions available from the Dictionary Editor: 
This dialog is used to start the single (SQL based) or multiple (any file system) table import option from your data 
dictionary. Launched from the Synchronize button or Dictionary Synchronizer menu item in the Dictionary Editor. 
This dialog is also used to begin the stand-alone generation of a multi-table conversion program. Launched from the 
Create Conversion Program for Multiple Tables menu item in the Dictionary Editor. 
 
CLICK on the Next button to continue. 
 
Synchronizer Wizard - Select Other Dictionary 
The Data Dictionary Synchronizer synchronizes the active dictionary in the Clarion Dictionary Editor with another 
database or data dictionary. 
Press the ellipsis button to select the "other" database or dictionary with the Windows file dialog. If the data dictionary 
resides in several files (such as a set of Btrieve .DDFs), then select the directory that contains the definition files. 
This dialog changes slightly when the Synchronizer is used to only generate a multi-table conversion program. You are 
asked "Which dictionary contains the Old file definitions?". Make sure that the OLD dictionary is the dictionary that 
contains the SOURCE file definitions to be converted. The NEW dictionary contains the TARGET file definitions to convert 
to. 
  
For SQL databases (such as ORACLE ), the Synchronizer Wizard prompts you for the logon information needed to 
connect to the SQL database. 
CLICK on the Next button to continue. 
 
Synchronizer Wizard - Server Login Info 
Provide the appropriate connection information for your backend database. This is specific to the type of backend 
database you are using. 
 
Synchronizer Wizard - Select Previous Session File 
The Previous Session file (*.SYN) stores information about the synchronization of two particular dictionaries. Specifically, 
it stores the files to synchronize from the source dictionary, the files to synchronize from the target dictionary, and a list of 
matching items (files, fields, keys, and aliases) between the two dictionaries.  
 If you wish to save the synchronization information, or if you wish to reuse the information from a prior synchronization, 
you may specify a filename for the Previous Session file.  
Press the ellipsis button to select a Previous Session file with the Windows file dialog, or type the Previous Session file 
pathname. 
CLICK on the Next button to continue.

Synchronizer Wizard - Select Synchronize Direction 
The Data Dictionary Synchronizer never modifies the source dictionary; it only modifies the target dictionary. 
Specify whether the open data dictionary is the source or the target by CLICKING the appropriate radio button. 
 
Whenever you consolidate two Clarion dictionaries into a single dictionary, you risk damaging the relationship between 
the replaced dictionary and its corresponding applications, unless you first export those applications to text (.TXA) format.  
CLICK on the Next button to continue. 
 
Synchronizer Wizard - Options 
These wizard synchronizer options operate exactly the same as the global synchronizer options described in the 
Dictionary Synchronizer Options section. Changing the settings here automatically updates the global settings and vice 
versa. See the Dictionary Synchronizer Options section for more information. 
CLICK on the Matchings button to tell the synchronizer how to match files, fields, keys, and aliases between the two 
dictionaries.  
 
Proper matching of dictionary items is essential to producing a useful synchronization. 
 
Synchronizer Wizard - Select files from Clarion Dictionary 
Select which files, views, and tables within the Clarion data dictionary to include in the synchronization process. The 
Synchronizer Wizard provides two file lists for the data dictionary: on the left is a list of files not synchronized and on the 
right is a list of files to synchronize. Depending on the database server, the list may show filenames, table names, owner 
names, etc. 
  
 
The Synchronizer Wizard lists the files in the order specified on the Options page, that is, alphabetically or according to 
the source dictionary. 
It is to your advantage to include as few files as possible in the synchronization process because fewer files results in a 
faster process.  
Add > 
Press this button to move the highlighted file and all related files and aliases to the Files to Synchronize list. 
Alternatively, DOUBLE-CLICK the file to synchronize. 
< Remove 
Press this button to move the highlighted file and all related files to the Files not Synchronized list. 
Add All >> 
Press this button to move all the files to the Files to Synchronize list. 
<< Remove All 
Press this button to move all the files to the Files not Synchronized list. 
CLICK on the Next button to select which files within the other database/dictionary to include in the synchronization 
process. This page works exactly like the previous file selection page, with one exception: if the other dictionary is a not a 
Clarion dictionary, loading and updating the file list takes significantly longer than for a Clarion dictionary. 
CLICK on the Finish button to continue.

Synchronizer Wizard - Matching Options 
Proper matching of dictionary items is essential to produce a useful synchronization. The synchronizer provides a range of 
automatic, intelligent matching choices, which you can combine with manual matchings to quickly and accurately match 
your dictionary items. 
Any items the synchronizer cannot match automatically are flagged within the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog so you 
can manually match them. See Synchronize Dictionaries Dialog for more information. 
Historically 
The Synchronizer matches the items based on the synchronizer file you specified earlier. This choice is disabled if you 
specified a new synchronizer file or no synchronizer file. 
By Name Only 
The Synchronizer matches the items based on their labels and external names.  
By Order Only 
The Synchronizer matches the items based on the order they appear in the two dictionaries. 
This option is not available for SQL databases. 
By Component Only 
The synchronizer matches keys based on the number and labels or external names of the key components. 
This option is not available for SQL databases. 
 
The availability of the matching rules depends on the particular database server. 
Manually 
The Synchronizer does not match items. You must match the items with the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog. 
CLICK on the OK button to return to the Options page, then CLICK on the Next button to continue. 
 
Pressing the finish button at this point matches the dictionaries according to these settings. For any manually matched 
items, all sub-items are matched using the settings. For example, if you match a file manually, all its fields are matched by 
name if By Name Only is specified.

Synchronizer Main Window 
When you "finish" the Synchronizer Wizard, it opens the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog. 
 
This window is shared between the Import Tables and Synchronize options found in the DCT Explorer. In the Import 
Tables function, this window will only appear if there are conflicts with existiong table names in your dictionary. Items in 
conflict are marked in red. 
 
The Synchronize Dictionaries dialog compares the two data dictionaries, item by item and lets you resolve any 
differences between them. It validates the proposed changes, then generates all the source code, scripts, and data 
definitions required to implement the changes. Finally, it gives you the opportunity to review and edit the generated source 
code or SQL scripts. 
Overview 
The Synchronize Dictionaries dialog uses a "file centric" hierarchical list to present the comparison. Beneath each file in 
the list, the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog nests the file's properties and components (fields, keys, relationships, and 
aliases). Beneath each item in the list, the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog nests that item's respective properties and 
components.  
 
CLICK on the plus (+) sign to expand a list item; CLICK on the minus (-) sign to contract an item.  
For every file, field, key, relationship, alias, and property in the list, the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog shows the value 
from each database or dictionary, plus status indicators to show whether the values are different, and how the difference 
is resolved (for example, ignore the difference, copy from source to target, delete item from target, not yet resolved, etc.). 
The Synchronize Dictionaries dialog either dims or omits database properties the target database/dictionary does not 
support, depending on the settings in the Synchronizer Options dialog (see Dictionary Synchronizer Options). 
Generally, follow these steps to synchronize the dictionaries: 
1. Configure the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog to sort dictionary items according to your preferences—
alphabetically or according to the source dictionary (use the View menu). 
2. Navigate to each unmatched item and make sure each one is properly matched to the corresponding item in the 
other dictionary by selecting a matching option from the Synchronize menu or the popup (RIGHT-CLICK) menu. 
Items may be left unmatched if there is no corresponding item in the other dictionary. 
3. Navigate to each difference and resolve it by selecting an option from the Synchronize menu or the popup 
(RIGHT-CLICK) menu. 
4. Press the OK button. 
  
Configuring the Synchronize Dictionaries Dialog 
By default, the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog displays files, fields, and keys in the order specified in the Synchronizer 
Options dialog. You can also set default colors and other behaviors with this dialog (see Dictionary Synchronizer 
Options). However, you can reset the various sort orders (files, fields, keys) at any time with the View menu.  
Status Indicators 
The Synchronize Dictionaries dialog uses status indicators as well as color to provide information about the current 
synchronization process. 
Status indicators are in the right-most column of the list. Status indicators include: 
• 
32-bit only. Since all applications generated in Clarion Win32 are 32-bit, this indicator can be ignored. 


---

IDE Reference 
217 
• 
File Structure (field order) changed. This indicates a field's position has changed within the target dictionary. This 
indicator is especially useful when fields are sorted alphabetically and their physical order is not readily visible. 
 
Invalid proposal below. This indicates there is an invalid proposal further down in the hierarchy. Expand the tree or use 
the navigation controls to find the violation. 
 
Invalid proposal. This indicates the proposed change cannot be accepted by the target server and disables the OK button. 
For example, number of characters not valid for current data type. 
RIGHT-CLICK on this icon then choose Display Validation Error to see an explanation of the violation. 
 
If you have elected to resolve conflicts automatically (see Dictionary Synchronizer Options) and the conflict can be 
resolved automatically, then this status indicator is not set!  
  
Color 
Color indicators include: 
Blue 
indicates no action is applied, and the item is either different than its matching item or it has no matching item. 
Black 
indicates an action is applied and the resulting target item is valid, or no action is applied but none is needed because the 
items match and the target item is valid. 
Red 
indicates an action is applied and the resulting target item is not valid—the target does not support the applied property. 
You must resolve the invalid proposal before you can complete the synchronization. In the Import Tables function, tables 
in your existing dictionary that match those that you are importing will be marked in red. 
Gray 
The item is not supported by the target dictionary. 
Navigating the Synchronizer Tree 
The Synchronizer provides the following navigation aids to let you quickly identify and resolve differences between the 
two data dictionaries: 
  
Go to the previous difference—automatically expands the list as required. Alternatively choose Edit Previous 
Difference. 
Go to the next difference—automatically expands the list as required. Alternatively choose Edit bmc C6H0013.BMP} Next 
Difference. 
Go to the previous invalid proposal—automatically expands the list as required. Alternatively choose Edit  Previous 
Invalid Proposal. 
Go to the next invalid proposal—automatically expands the list as required. Alternatively choose Edit  Next Invalid 
Proposal. 
  
Matching Unmatched Items 
The Synchronize menu (and the RIGHT-CLICK popup menu) contains all the functions needed to match items between 
the two dictionaries. 
Match 
Associates the selected item with an unmatched item in the other dictionary. The Synchronizer moves the matched items 
onto the same row. RIGHT-CLICK or press ESC to abort the match. 


---

IDE Reference 
218 
Unmatch 
This uncouples the selected items and moves them to separate rows so they can be rematched. This is for items that 
were matched inadvertently or which should not be matched. 
Match by Name 
Unmatches the selected item and rematches it by name. 
Match by Order 
Unmatches the selected item and rematches it by order of the source dictionary. 
Match by Component 
Unmatches the selected key and rematches it based on component fields. 
  
 
DRAG from a source column in one row and DROP on a target column in another row to match the two items. If either 
item was already matched, this operation first unmatches the original match. 
Relationships are matched automatically, based on the files and keys the relationship uses.  
  
Resolving Differences Between Dictionaries 
All differences between source and target dictionaries can be resolved by applying an appropriate operations to each 
item. The Synchronize menu (and the RIGHT-CLICK popup menu) contains all the operations needed to resolve 
differences between the two dictionaries. 
The Synchronize Dictionaries dialog uses action indicators to provide information about the current synchronization 
process. 
  
Synchronizer Actions and Action Icons 
Action icons are between the source and target columns of the list. Applying an action to any item in the list affects the 
selected item and its children. The action applied to an item cascades to any nested items. The primary item's action icon 
is in full color; the cascaded action indicators are gray. 
  
 
Choose Edit Undo to undo the last action. 
The Synchronize Dictionaries dialog shows the proposed action for each item in the list. The action icons are in the 
column between the two dictionaries. Synchronizer actions and their corresponding action icons are: 
Icon 
Menu Selection and explanation of synchronizer action 
 
No decision. This is not a menu selection. It is the initial state of the 
Synchronize Dictionaries dialog before any actions are applied. This 
state does not change the target dictionary. 
 
Add to target 
Add only. Adds the selected source dictionary items to the target 
dictionary. This applies only to source items with no matching target 
items. This action only adds new items in the target dictionary. 
 
Copy to target

the target dictionary. 
 
Merge into target 
Add and change. For matching items, this action copies properties 
from source to target; it adds unmatched source items to the target 
dictionary; it ignores any unmatched target items. This action can add 
new items to, and change existing items in the target dictionary. This 
action makes the target dictionary a union of the source and target. 
 
Replace target 
Add, change, and delete. For matching items, this action copies 
properties from source to target; it adds unmatched source items to 
the target dictionary; it deletes unmatched target items. This action 
can add new items to, change existing items in, and delete items from 
the target dictionary. This action changes the target item to exactly 
match the source item. 
 
Delete from target 
Delete only. Deletes the selected items from the target dictionary. 
This applies only to target items with no matching source items. 
  
  
 
Ignore Difference 
Ignore. Ignore the selected items. This action does not change the 
target dictionary. 
  
  
Set to Default 
Parent. Applies the parent's action to the selected items. This action is 
available only if you have previously changed a child's default 
operation. 
  
  
 
 
Choose Edit Undo to undo the last menu selection. 
 
Implementing the Changes 
When you have matched all relevant database items, and resolved all differences and invalid proposals in the 
Synchronize Dictionaries dialog, you can implement any proposed changes by pressing the OK button. 
The Synchronizer creates the data conversion program, backs up the target dictionary, and generates the new target 
dictinary or database definition in the appropriate format—Clarion .DCT or .TXD file, Btrieve .DDF files, or SQL script. 
You may execute the SQL script, or you may save the script, optionally edit it, and execute it later. The SQL script both 
updates the structure of the database and converts existing data to the new structure. 
The Synchronizer creates back up files by renaming the original target file—Synchronizer changes the first position of 
the file extension to a 'B.' So *.DCT is backed up to *.BCT, *.TXD is backed up to *.BXD, *.DDF is backed up to *.BDF, 
etc. 
  
Running the SQL Script 
How you run the generated SQL script depends on the SQL server. See your SQL database documentation for 
instructions on storing and running scripts.

Synchronizer Validation Error Window 
This window provides an explanation of the validation error. This error must be resolved before you can synchronize the 
dictionaries. 
 
Synchronizer Options Dialog 
The Dictionary Synchronizer is configurable. That is, to some extent you can determine how the synchronizer looks and 
acts. The main synchronizer elements you can configure are  
• 
colors, 
• 
sort sequences, 
• 
automatic generation of data conversion program,  
• 
automatic resolution of conflicts. 
The default settings are suitable for many cases so you probably don't need to change these settings at first. However, at 
some point you may want to change the default settings.  
To reconfigure the synchronizer, choose Setup Dictionary Synchronizer Options. 
 
You can change many of these settings with the View menu while the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog is open.

IDE Reference 
221 
Batch Synchronization 
For every synchronization, the Dictionary Synchronizer creates a log called synlog.txt in the root directory of the current 
drive (root:\synlog.txt). This log serves two purposes: it can be used to rerun a synchronization in batch mode, and it 
should be submitted with any bug reports along with the synchronized data dictionaries to aid in the debugging process. 
After you finish a synchronization (either successfully or unsuccessfully), you can use this log file to automatically rerun 
the synchronization in batch mode. This can save lots of time for large or repetitive synchronization tasks.  
To Synchronize in batch mode: 
1. Copy or rename the root:\synlog.txt to another location (otherwise the next synchronization will overwrite it). 
2. Use the copy of synlog.txt as the first parameter in the RerunSynchronizer DDE command (see example 
program). 
The second parameter is the Clarion dictionary that started the original synchronization—not necessarily the source 
dictionary. 
3. Run the example program.  
The synchronizer starts and repeats the steps logged in the synlog.txt file. Note: If you pressed OK or Cancel at the end of 
a synchronize, you may want to delete those commands from the synlog.txt file.

File Import Window 
  
The File Import dialog is used to enter the required connection information to a data source that you are attempting to 
import into your data dictionary. 
  
Connection 
Enter or paste a valid connection string to use to connect to your data source. Press the ellipsis button to call the 
Microsoft Data Link interface, which is used to construct a valid connection string for you. 
  
User ID 
If your data source requires a User ID to connect, enter it here, or select a previously used User ID from the drop list 
provided. 
  
Password 
If your data source requires a valid password to connect, enter it here, or select a previously used Password from the drop 
list provided. 
  
Include/Exclude System Files 
Check the appropriate radio button to include or exclude all system files associated with the data source. Normally, 
system files are administrative in nature and should be excluded from your import.

Dictionary Synchronizer Options 
Sort files alphabetically 
Checking this box displays files and aliases in alphabetical order on the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog. Clearing the 
box displays them in the order they are defined in the source database.  
You may also specify the display order during synchronization by choosing View Sort files alphabetically.  
Sort fields alphabetically 
Checking this box displays fields in alphabetical order on the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog. Clearing the box displays 
them in the order they are defined in the source database.  
You may also specify the display order during synchronization by choosing View Sort fields alphabetically.  
Sort keys alphabetically 
Checking this box displays keys in alphabetical order on the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog. Clearing the box displays 
them in the order they are defined in the source database.  
You may also specify the display order during synchronization by choosing View Sort keys alphabetically.  
Create conversion program 
Checking this box tells the synchronizer to automatically generate a Clarion program to convert existing data to the new 
format of the target database.  
 
This box is disabled when the target is an SQL database, because no separate conversion program is required. Rather, 
the synchronizer generates an SQL script to both change the database definition and convert existing data.  
Hide unsupported attributes 
Checking this box tells the synchronizer to hide (omitted from the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog) any attributes of the 
database the synchronizer server does not support. Clearing the box tells the synchronizer to display the unsupported 
attributes, but as disabled (dimmed) items. 
Correct validity violations automatically 
Checking this box tells the synchronizer to automatically resolve conflicts where possible. Clearing the box tells the 
synchronizer to display the Invalid Proposal icon so you can resolve the problem manually. 
For example, a field data type is record picture, but the target dictionary does not support record picture, so the 
synchronizer automatically resolves the violation by applying the same operation on record picture as on data type. 
  
 
The synchronizer cannot automatically resolve some conflicts, such as maximum number of MEMO fields exceeded. 
If you have elected to resolve conflicts automatically and the conflict can be resolved automatically, then the unresolved 
difference status indicator in the Synchronize Dictionaries dialog is not set!  
  
Generate DBA instruction script 
Use this option when synchronizing to an existing SQL database. Checking this box tells the synchronizer to generate 
instructions for modifying an existing SQL database. The instructions are an approximation of the SQL needed to achieve 
the change.

IDE Reference

Resolving Invalid Proposals 
Invalid proposed changes to the target dictionary can be resolved in two ways: from within the Synchronizer and from 
outside the synchronizer. 
Within the Synchronizer, choose Display Validation Error from the menu to find out exactly what the problem is. Display 
Validation Error  
Provides information about the nature of the invalid proposal—describes why it is invalid. 
If you don't need the offending item in the target dictionary/database, you can proceed with the synchronization by 
unmatching the item (RIGHT-CLICK the item then choose UnMatch from the popup menu), then deleting it from the 
target (RIGHT-CLICK the item then choose Delete from the popup menu). 
If you do need the item in the target, you may be able to resolve the violation by changing the Synchronizer operation 
applied to the item. For example, if you copied the item from the source to the target (you chose Copy to Target from the 
menu), then all properties of the source item (including any unsupported properties) are applied to the target item, 
resulting in an invalid proposal. Changing the operation from "copy" to "ignore" should resolve the problem (RIGHT-CLICK 
the item then choose Ignore Differences from the popup menu) because the Synchronizer does not copy the source item 
properties to the target item. 
Alternatively, you may resolve the violation by canceling the synchronizer session, changing the offending data 
declaration in the source dictionary/database, then resynchronizing.

Conditional Generation Mode 
Choose from three options. Use the default setting as defined in the Application Options dialog, or override those 
settings by switching to Conditional or Unconditional Generation.. 
Generate Trace File 
Source Generation optionally includes a trace option as defined in the Application Options dialog. You can also override 
those settings by switching to Generate or Don’t Generate as needed. This file should be use only for diagnostic 
purposes, as it can sometimes affect generation performance. 
 
"Opened" applications are applications that are either loaded in the Application Editor, or, they can be applications that 
are "lazy loaded", meaning that the application registry and any parsing of source libraries required by the templates has 
been performed. 
Open (or "lazy loaded") applications in the Applications Pad are identified by the following icon: 
 
Applications not opened (or "lazy loaded") are identified by the following icon. 
 
 
If you select an application to generate, and the application is not already opened, the Generate action will "lazy load" the 
application as described above. 
Generate All 
Generates source for all applications listed in the Applications Pad. Applications not marked as opened will be "lazy 
loaded" as described above. 
These "generate" buttons can also be found on the Main IDE Toolbar. 
 
Data Sources View 
The Data Sources View displays a hierarchal tree of files, queues, groups and other structures detected in the current 
active project. This pad is used to quickly populate components in windows and reports. 
Simply drag and drop the desired data element from this view to the target window area.

Data / Tables Pad 
The Data / Tables Pad (DTP) is a special pad that displays the contents of an active dictionary and other application data 
elements (Global, Module, and Local). This pad is available when either the Dictionary Editor or Application Generator is 
opened. 
 
Tables and application data is displayed and maintained from a single source pad. Press the F12 key at any time to open 
(or bring focus to) the DTP in the IDE. Buttons at the top of the DTP lists allow you to add, modify, or remove data 
elements where appropriate. 
When the Application Editor is active, data in the DTP that is disabled indicates that the global data source is from the 
global pool of the active dictionary, and may not be deleted. 
In the Window and Report Designers, drag a field (column) from the DTP to the window or report area for easy and quick 
population. The Populate Columns and Populate Multiple Columns utilities that you used in earlier version are also 
available in Clarion Win32 if you would prefer to use them instead. Access these utilities from the Window or Report 
Designer menus. 
You can also view the DTP from the Dictionary Editor as an alternative view of your dictionary schema.

Dictionary Changes Pad 
The Dictionary Changes pad shows all automatic changes that have been applied to the dictionary. You can double click 
on any item in the pad and that item will be opened in the dictionary editor. 
 
Classes View 
The purpose of the Classes View is to display all code and data objects in use by the active project. It also serves as an 
easy way to locate the target source module where the selected object is defined. 
In the toolbar, use the arrow keys to traverse between class branches. There is also a drop list available in the toolbar 
where you can limit the tree to the type of objects that you wish to display. 
  
In the tree list, you can right-click on any object, and Rename any class element or Find References where that class 
member is referenced in source throughout the entire project. 
 
Window Designer - Properties Pad 
The Window Designer's Properties Pad allows you to quickly specify the appearance and content of the text on each 
control within the window and on the window title bar. Control the font, size, style, and content of all your text, using 
standard entry fields and drop down lists. Every property of a selected control is listed in this pad. 
Display and get focus to the Properties Pad by choosing View Properties, or press the F4 key. Resize the Properties 
Pad by placing the cursor on the border of the box. When the cursor changes to a double headed arrow, CLICK and 
DRAG. Use the toolbar buttons to change the sort appearance. 
 
As you multi-select controls in the Designer (CTRL + CLICK), any change in a property in the Properties Pad will affect all 
selected controls. 
You can manually enter in property values in the pad, or clicking on the property name will cycle through valid choices 
where applicable. In many properties, there are lookup buttons that display additional selection dialogs.

Solution Explorer 
The Solution Explorer window organizes all essential components, and provides access to other dialogs that set additional 
project options. 
The Solution or Project file tracks all the components that make up the final executable file. It also sets the compiler 
options ranging from whether to include debug code or not, to setting a preferred optimization method. The majority of 
actions you can execute in the Solution Explorer are found in the Popup Menu options.  
If you use the Application Generator to create your source code, the only thing you will probably use the Project System 
for is to set debugging options. 
Tree List 
The Tree List itemizes the file level elements which comprise your project, 
including source code files, file drivers, other projects to compile, external 
libraries and resources, and other programs to execute as part of the 
make process. 
  
Note: Assemblies that are referenced by default by Clarion# compiler now 
visible in the Project Browser (grayed) and available for code completion. 
  
Properties 
The Properties button 
 calls a dialog allowing you to specify compile 
options for the selected item, or the entire project. The particular dialog 
which appears depends on the currently selected item. You can also right-
click on any tree item, and select the Properties menu item (when 
appropriate). 
  
When you select the root project item (e.g., the project itself), the Global 
Options dialog appears. This allows you to set compile options for the 
project. 
  
When you select a source code file, the Properties dialog appears. This 
provides a limited set of options that apply only to the selected file. 
Show All Files 
Press the Show All Files button 
 to show all appropriate project files. 
Refresh 
Press the Refresh button 
 to refresh and collapse the project tree. 
Open 
For hand-coded projects, if a source code file is selected, 
 calls the 
Text Editor and loads it into a source code document window. 
Right-clicking on selected tree items enable a popup menu with the following items:

Add 
Calls a sub-menu that is appropriate for the selected tree item. You can 
add new or existing projects to the current project, new folders and 
items, and drivers, libraries, resources, and source files where 
appropriate. 
You can specify that another project is built in the course of building the 
current project. You can add icons that link into your executable so they 
do not have to be shipped separately. For hand coded applications, you 
can insert new .CLW files. Database Drivers can also be added here. 
This section is also used to include manifest files in hand coded 
projects. 
You can also include Version Info Script files here. These files allow you 
to enter and control specific version information for this application. A 
script file must have a .version extension. For more information, see 
Version Information Resource Files. 
You can also add external resources, such as .CUR, or .ICO files if they 
were not explicitly named as attributes in your source code. For 
example, if you specify variable naming a bitmap file in an IMAGE 
control (such as !MyBMP.BMP), you can link it in by adding it to the 
Project Tree below this item. 
Delete 
Allows you to remove the currently selected item from the Project Tree. 
This does not physically remove the file from disk. 
Standard options for Cut, Copy, Paste and Rename are also available via the popup menu.

Solution Explorer Popup Menu Options 
Each branch of the Solution Explorer had a set of popup menu items that pertain to that particular area. Many of these 
items are also available through the IDE Main Menu. Below is a summary of these pop up menu items 
The Solution Branch 
Build Solution 
Builds the active solution. The Build Solution option compiles 
only those project files and components that have changed 
since the last build. 
Rebuild Solution 
The Rebuild Solution option builds all project files and 
components irrespective of the changes made to them. 
Clean Solution 
Deletes all files from the target project folders. This action uses 
an XML based "FileList" that was generated by the first Build 
activity. If you attempt to clean a solution that has never been 
built, you will receive a project warning that it could not be 
cleaned. 
Add > New Project 
Used to add a new project to the existing solution. Opens the 
IDE New Project dialog 
Add > Existing Project 
Used to add an existing project to the Solution tree. Opens a 
filtered File Dialog window with valid projects displayed. Valid 
project may be in current MSBuild format, or legacy project files 
used in prior version of Clarion. 
Add > Item 
Used to add any item to the current Solution tree. Opens a 
generic File Dialog window listing all files. 
Add > New Solution Folder 
Used to add a new folder to the current solution. Examples of 
Items stored in this folder might be documentation or other 
references that are not directly a part of the Build process. 
Paste 
Used to Paste other Projects to the target Solution 
Rename 
Used to rename the current Solution. You can make your 
solution more descriptive if needed. 
Properties 
Opens the Properties Pad. In the Solution branch, this list is 
empty. 
Edit Project Dependencies 
Opens the Project Dependency Editor, which allows you to add 
and remove project dependencies. 
  
The Project Branch 
Every solution must have at least one project branch. In the case of multi-DLL projects, there is usually more than one. 
Build/Rebuild/Clean 
Similar in function to the Solution options discussed above, but 
focuses only on the current project selected. 
Add > New Item 
Opens the Add File dialog, where you can add a Program

Toolbox View 
Toolbox View 
The Toolbox View provides a list of handy tools that you can use for any target source file. The similarity between all tools 
is that you can drag and drop a selected item directly to source, or to a target Window/Report Designer where 
appropriate. 
The following tools are currently available always: 
ASCII Table 
The ASCII Table contains the ASCII Decimal and Hex code, and actual character for each. Only displayable characters 
are shown. 
General 
Currently this tool is empty and inactive. 
Clipboard Ring 
The Clipboard Ring displays the text of recent items copied to the clipboard (CTRL + C).You can quickly Paste these 
items to a selected source area by dragging the selection from the Toolbox. 
When the Designers are active, the following tools are also available: 
Clarion Window Controls (Clarion Win32 Only) 
Displays a list of valid controls used in any WINDOW structure. Click and drag the selected control and drop in the work 
area of the target window structure while the Designer is active. 
Clarion Report Controls 
Displays a list of valid controls used in any REPORT structure. Click and drag the selected control and drop in the work 
area of the target report structure while the Designer is active. 
 
The family of Clarion# Designers display additional categories of controls. To add or modify new categories to the toolbox, 
right-click on any area of the toolbox and select the Configure Sidebar option.

IDE Reference 
236 
Configure Sidebar 
The Configure Sidebar dialog displays special add on control assemblies that allow you to extend your available library 
of controls. 
Adding a new category is a two step process: 
1. 1. Press the New button to add a new Category. 
2. 2. Highlight the category just added, and press the Add Components button. This will pop up an additional dialog 
that will allow you to select a valid DLL assembly from the Global Assembly Cache (GAC), or from another 
location (Custom) 
 
Add Components 
This dialog is used with the Configure Sidebar interface, and displays when you add any components to an existing 
category. 
It allows you to select a valid DLL assembly from the Global Assembly Cache (GAC), or from another location (Custom). 
The IDE is intelligent and detects that the assembly you have selected is valid or not for the category.

Performance Tips (IDE) 
Performance Tips 
This topic contains tips to improve the overall performance of the Clarion IDE on your computer, and the minimum and 
recommended system requirements. 
  
General tips: 
1. Turn off virus checking on the Clarion.exe program. 
2. Defragment your hard disk after you install Clarion. 
3. Check that your system meets the RAM and processor recommendations and then consider whether to upgrade 
the memory or disk speed. 
  
System Requirements: 
  
Minimum 
1.6 GHz CPU, 384 MB RAM, 1024x768 display, 5400 RPM hard drive  
  
Recommended:  
2.2 GHZ or higher CPU, 1024 MB or more RAM, 1280x1024 display, 7200 RPM or  
higher hard drive. If Running on Windows Vista: 2.4 GHz CPU, 768 MB RAM  
  
IDE Tips 
When you have the Clarion integrated development environment (IDE) open: 
  
1. Before you exit the IDE, close the pads that you do not use at startup. This can increase your startup speed the 
next time that you start the IDE. 
  
2. Do not display the Properties Pad at startup. The Properties Pad displays automatically when you open a 
solution. 
  
Processor and Memory 
For the best performance of the Clarion IDE, you want to get a dual core or better CPU. We also recommend getting at 
least 2GB or more of RAM. Make sure you always get the fastest possible hard-drive when buying a new machine - and 
where necessary trade off purchasing additional CPU processor speed in favor of a faster disk instead.

IDE Reference 
238 
Hard Drives 
The default hard drive speed for most PC laptops is typically 5400rpm - which is a pretty slow drive in comparison. If you 
are getting a new laptop and plan to use Clarion on it, we recommend making sure you get a 7200rpm drive instead. You 
will realize a significant performance benefit by doing this. 
For a desktop machine hard drive, consider getting a 10000rpm hard drive, or even better a 15000 RPM drive. These 
make a very big difference over the default 7200rpm drives that typically come with desktops. You should also check the 
drive’s cache size. Older drives have 1MB or 2MB of cache. But you can get drives with 8MB and 16MB caches which will 
speed up the performance of the drive. 
You could also consider buying a second physical hard drive and setup your operating system and OS virtual memory 
swap file to use one of the physical drives, and store all your data on the second physical drive. The benefit is that your 
read/write data operations won't be competing for disk I/O activity with the operating system updating the virtual memory 
file.

IDE Reference 
239 
Project System 
 
Database Driver Libraries 
Your application calls various database driver routines to access your database tables. These routines are in libraries 
supplied with Clarion and installed by default in the \LIB subdirectory by the Clarion setup program. During the link 
process, references to these external routines can only be resolved if the library containing the routines is added to your 
project file. 
The Application Generator automatically adds the appropriate driver libraries based on the Data 
Dictionary table driver selections and the Project System settings. For hand-coded projects, you 
should manually add the appropriate driver libraries. 
To link a database driver library, highlight Database driver libraries in the Project Tree list. Then press the Add File 
button and select the driver to add from the Select Driver dialog. 
 
Generalize Name 
The Generalize Name option is found by right-clicking on any library name in the project tree. The IDE reads the library 
and attempts to generalize key designations, like link mode and version. 
For example, given the following library name: 
  
## C60PRLBX.LIB
  
The Transformed Library Name will become: 
  
## C%V%PRLB%X%.LIB
  
This allows you to easily switch versions without having to remove and include new libraries.

New Project File Dialog 
This dialog allows you to type in the basic information the Project System needs to create a new project file (.CWPRJ for 
Win32, .CNPRJ for Clarion.NET) and solution file (*.SLN). 
Categories 
Select a valid category. For Win32 projects, select Clarion for 
Windows. For Clarion.NET, you have three sub categories to create 
desktop (Window Applications), web based (ASP.NET), or Mobile 
(Compact Framework) projects. 
Quick Starts 
Specify the type of project that you wish to create. In Clarion for 
Windows, the Quick Starts available are hand coded DLL, EXE, or 
Library projects, or Applications (from scratch or from an existing TXA 
file). A TXA file is an application in a special text format. Select the 
Application Quick Start here. Clarion.Net choices are more diverse, 
depending on the sub-category you havew selected. 
Name 
Type in a project name which displays at the top of the Tree List in the 
Project View. 
Location 
Type in (or select with the Browse for Folder dialog after pressing the 
ellipsis button) the location where the project will be created. 
Create directory for 
Sources 
Check this box to specify a subdirectory with the project name that will 
be created at the Location you specified. 
Auto create project 
subdir 
Check this box to autocreate a project folder that uses the project 
Name and Location specidfied. For example, if the name of the 
project is Orders and the Location is C:\Example, a sub-folder named 
Orders will be created in the Example folder.

Project Copy System 
The new project system copy system is very complete and flexible. 
Whenever you build an executable (EXE), all necessary dynamic link libraries (DLLs) will be copied to the directory where 
that EXE is located. 
In the following list the term "valid referenced project" means any referenced project that does not have the Copy Child 
Dlls to output directory property set to Never (which is visible in the Properties pad when you highlight any referenced 
project) and has the Copy Referenced Dlls to output property set to TRUE (which is visible on the Compiling tab of the 
Project Property window). 
 
The system finds the DLLs based on: 
• 
Referenced projects that DO NOT have Copy Dll to output directory set to Never. 
• 
Library (LIB) files in this project that DO NOT have the Copy Dll to output directory set to Never 
• 
Library (LIB) files in a valid referenced project that does not have the Copy Dll to output directory property set 
to Never. 
• 
File drivers included in this project 
• 
File drivers included in a valid referenced project 
• 
Library (LIB) files included via PRAGMA statements in the code for this project 
• 
Library (LIB) files included via PRAGMA statements in the code for a valid referenced project. 
• 
Files in the project with the Copy to output directory property not set to Never 
• 
Files with the Copy to output directory property not set to Never in a valid referenced project 
• 
The active runtime DLL (c%V%run.dll) 
  
Overriding all of this is the LibIgnoreList.xml file located in the  
Application Data\SoftVelocity\Clarion\7.0 directory. Any library file in that file will never have its 'matching' DLL copied. 
This file is to be used for library files that do not have a matching DLL. 
Note that the copying only happens when the target of the project is an EXE and only if you have the Copy Referenced 
Dlls to output property set to TRUE (the default).

Project Dependency Editor 
The Project Dependency Editor is called from the popup menu of the Solution Node in the Solution Explorer. 
  
 
  
The list on the left displays dependencies of the selected project in the drop list above. Check a project to easily add it as 
a dependency, or uncheck to remove it.  
On the right, the build order of all project is displayed. Changing the dependencies in the left list will automatically change 
the order on the right when needed. 
 
Project Redirection 
A new feature of the C7 project system is the ability to set default project settings through redirection. 
  
solglobals.pi and cwglobals.pi 
Whenever a project is built with C7, the project system uses the redirection file to look for a file called solglobals.pi. If it 
finds it, this file is included at the beginning of the project. Regardless of the existence of solglobals.pi, it then looks for a 
file called cwglobals.pi. If this is found, it is then included into the project. Finally, the project file is read. 
  
This process allows you to put project settings specific for a solution in solglobals.pi and project settings you want to set 
for all your projects in cwglobals.pi. 


---

IDE Reference 
243 
Project Redirection Tasks 
The C7 project system uses MSBuild to build projects and solutions. MSBuild uses XML files to control how projects are 
built. You should look in the Microsoft help for detailed information on how MSBuild files work. 
  
One feature of MSBuild is that you can add extra tasks. A task available to Clarion developers is the Redirection task. 
This allows you to get the full path of a file using the redirection system. 
  
To use this task in an MSBuild project you need to add the following line to the top of the file: 
  
<UsingTask TaskName="Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Redirection" 
AssemblyFile="$(ClarionBinPath)\SoftVelocity.CW.Build.Tasks.dll"/> 
  
The following table describes the parameters of the Redirection task. 
  
Parameter  
Description  
File 
Required String parameter. Specifies the file that should be found via 
redirection 
  
  
Version 
Optional String parameter. Specifies the version of Clarion to be used. If 
not specified, the current version of Clarion is used 
  
  
ForOpen 
Optional Boolean parameter. If true, OutputPath is set to the path where 
the file exists. If false, OutputPath is set to the path where the file will be 
created. If not specified, true is assumed. If ForOpen is true and the file 
does not exist, OutputPath is set to an empty string. 
  
  
RedirectionDirectory 
Optional String parameter. The directory where the redirection file is 
located. If not specified, the current directory is used. 
  
  
OutputPath 
Optional String output parameter. Contains the full path of the file.

Project System Quick Start 
The Clarion Win32 project system has been updated and upgraded to use the MSBuild project engine. MSBuild is the 
extensible, XML-based build engine that ships with the .NET Framework 2.0 and higher. MSBuild simplifies the process of 
creating and maintaining build scripts, and formalizes the steps required to institute a formal build process. 
The complete reference guide to MSBuild can be found at the following link: 
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wea2sca5(VS.80).aspx  
All Clarion Win32 projects use a default extension of *.CWPROJ. 
Here is a sample listing: 
<Project DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"> 
  <PropertyGroup> 
    <OutputName>people</OutputName> 
    <Model>Dll</Model> 
    <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration> 
    <Platform Condition=" '$(Platform)' == '' ">Win32</Platform> 
    <DefineConstants>_ABCDllMode_=&gt;0;_ABCLinkMode_=&gt;1</DefineConstants> 
    <ProjectGuid>{FFFF1465-30CB-4F2D-A01C-AF2E646CA106}</ProjectGuid> 
  </PropertyGroup> 
  <PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug' "> 
    <vid>full</vid> 
    <check_stack>True</check_stack> 
    <check_index>True</check_index> 
  </PropertyGroup> 
  <PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == 'Release' "> 
    <vid>off</vid> 
    <check_stack>False</check_stack> 
    <check_index>False</check_index>

    <Compile Include="peopl001.clw" /> 
  </ItemGroup> 
  <Import Project="$(ClarionBinPath)\SoftVelocity.Build.Clarion.targets" /> 
</Project> 
All projects compiled in Clarion Win32 are stored in solution files (*.SLN). These files can store multiple projects, and 
allow multiple resources to be referenced and included. 
Think of the projects used in earlier versions of Clarion as a subset of any solution. 
 
For your convenience, we also have included the project system documentation for the versions of Clarion prior to Version 
7.

Project Properties - Clarion Win32 
Project Properties 
 
These dialogs allow you to set compile options for the project, or its components. The options vary according to the item 
selected in the Project Tree dialog at the time you press the Properties button. 
When you select a "folder level" item (such the project itself), the Project Properties dialog appears. This allows you to 
set compile options for the project. 
Throughout the project settings you will notice the following button: 
 
This button allows you to choose in selected areas how a project setting will be stored. Configuration-specific means the 
setting can have a different value in each configuration (Debug/Release). Platform-specific means the setting can have a 
different value on each platform (target O/S). You can also choose to store the setting in the .user-file instead of the 
project file, so that every developer can use a different value without getting conflicts in source control systems. 
By default, all setting are project specific. 
The Project Properties dialog contain the following options. 
Configuration 
Specify which Project configuration options you wish to set. Select Build 
or Release from the drop list provided. To change the Build target, use 
the Build/Set Configuration menu option. 
Platform 
Current default for Clarion Win32 is Win32. 
Application 
Configuration Specify which Project configuration options you wish to set. Select Build or 
Release from the drop list provided. To change the Build target, use the 
Build/Set Configuration menu option. 
Platform 
Current default is AnyCPU. 
Target Name 
The output filename of the project. The Project System will use the description 
next to the Project name in the Project View tree list. It will also be the default 
project target filename (<output name.output.type>). Macros are allowed, but 
only %V%, %X% and %L%. 
Output Path 
The default target is based on the Project folder name and Build Configuration 
(e.g., <projectfolder>\debug or <projectfolder>\release). Use this option to 
specify an alternative target path where the target EXE, LIB, or DLL will be 
copied to. The only time you might want to use this is if you want to temporarily 
output a program you are creating to a different directory to preserve an old 
executable. 
Output Type 
Specify the type of executable file: choose .EXE, .LIB, or .DLL from the Target 
Type drop down list. 


---

IDE Reference 
248 
 
Link Mode 
Specifies how the runtime library is called by the target file: choose DLL LIB, 
or CustomDLL from the Link Mode drop down list.: 
  
DLL 
Uses the Clarion runtime library DLL (and database driver(s) 
.DLLs). It is called C70RUN.DLL. 
LIB 
Links the runtime library and any database drivers into your 
executable using Smart Method Linking (only the necessary 
portions are linked in). This creates a "one-piece" executable.  
CustomDLL 
Specifies that another External DLL contains the runtime libraries 
and database drivers. CustomDll means that all of the Clarion 
runtime DLLs have been built into a DLL that the user (you) has 
provided. As such no file drivers can be linked into the project. 
CustomDLL is essentially useless for template driven applications 
unless its your own custom template chain that doesn't add any of 
the Clarion drivers. The CustomDll setting is best suited for hand 
coders.The calls to this DLL must be exported. 
  
Application 
icon 
By inserting .ICO files after the Application icon item, you can link the icons 
into your executable so they do not have to be shipped separately. 
Project 
Information 
Displays the Project folder, Project file and Output name. These items are 
read-only. 
Build Events 
 
  
This dialog is used to specify optional commands to execute before and after the actual build sequence. Build events are 
executed only if the build successfully reaches those points in the build process. 
Build Events are useful for modifying manifest information, or updating build version numbers.

Compiling 
Conditional 
Compilation Symbols 
To define a switch, or switches, for use with the COMPILE and OMIT 
compiler directives, type a list of valid Clarion labels separated by 
semicolons. Each label defines a separate switch. 
For example, type 'Demo' in the entry field. The Project System will 
create a switch called Demo and turn it "on." Now you can use the 
switch in conditional COMPILE and OMIT statements within your 
source code. For example: 
  
  
## COMPILE('END COMPILE',DEMO=ON)
 IF TODAY() > FirstRunDate + 30  
  ReturnCode = MESSAGE('Beta period expired') 
## RETURN
 END 
## END COMPILE
  
  
You can also add new defines in the Conditional Compilation Symbols 
Dialog by pressing the ellipsis button to the right of the entry prompt. 
  
  
Stack Size 
To specify the stack size, type a value in Kilobytes in the Stack Size 
field.

IDE Reference 
250 
 
Copy Referenced 
DLLs to Output 
Directory 
This will copy the core dynamic linked libraries DLLs to the directory 
where the executable (or DLL) is being created. This means you no 
longer need to have different versions of Clarion on your environment 
path, thus allowing you to easily test with multiple versions of the 
same product. The redirection (RED) file is used to find DLLs 
when this check box is active. 
  
 
The PATH of core DLLs is automatically added by the installer. The 
same is of course true for all earlier versions of Clarion. So unless you 
have the case where you are maintaining separate distinct versions of 
C7 (or C6 etc.) then you do not need to use this option. 
The Project system uses the RED file to locate the DLLs. The 
standard RED file we ship has this entry in the Copy section; 
  
[Copy] 
-- Directories only used when copying dlls 
*.dll = %BIN%;%ROOT%\Accessory\bin 
  
Also. settings in a RED file found in the project directory take 
precedence over the base RED file settings. 
Examples of files copied would be file driver DLLs, runtime library 
DLLs, and any other DLLs that you have referenced in the active 
project. 
Debug Info 
Specifies the level of debug capability, choose Off, Min, or Full from 
the drop down list. 
Warning Level 
Specifies if all warnings should be treated as warnings (default), as 
errors, or ignored. 
Generate MAP File 
Creates a map file, which contains information about segment sizes 
and public functions. The map file may be used with third party 
debuggers. 
Add Line Number 
information to map 
file 
Check this box to build line numbers into the object file. This is not 
necessary for the Clarion debugger, but may be helpful when using 
other debuggers. 
Index out of range 
Enables "array index larger than the array size" warnings at runtime. 
Stack Overflow 
Enables stack overflow warnings at runtime.

Debug 
 
  
The options on this tab control actions when the debugger is called within the IDE. You can control the Start Action and 
other Start Options. 
Start Action 
The debugger can be launched in one of three ways. Start Project loads 
the debugger with the current active project. Start external program will 
launch an external program specified when the debugger is launched, or 
select the Start browser in URL so you can start a specific web page when 
the debugger is started. 
Start Options 
Optionally specify Command line arguments that will be used for the 
specific start action selected. You can also specify a Working directory as 
the debugger is launched.

Design 
Locked 
"Freezes" the break control so that subsequent data dictionary changes are not 
applied during application synchronization. 
  
Extra 
IgnoreCase 
Check this option if you would like to ensure a case insensitive break logic. This 
option is useful when a report is sorted by a case insensitive key, which could 
cause a "false break" between two string values that only vary in case (i.e., 
Defranco and DeFranco). 
  
General 
Label 
Type a valid Clarion labelDeclaration_and_Statement_Labels, naming the 
BREAKBREAK__declare_group_break_structure_ structure.  
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the BREAK structure. Type a field equate label 
to reference the BREAK structure in executable code. 
Variable 
Type a variable name, to generate a break when the value changes as you 
sequentially process the file. 
  
Group breaks provide a means of breaking the data into sections and optionally providing subtotals. Each group gathers a 
set of data file records, all sharing the same value in the BREAK field. Within a report, you may visually separate these 
rows, and add a subtotal or summary information, usually below the group. Group breaks are also called group bands by 
some popular end user database applications. 
The group break may contain the same elements as the report: a group HEADER, group DETAIL, and group FOOTER. 
These structures all print inside the DETAIL print area, each following the other by any offset specified in their AT 
attributes. 
Though they print on the page at the same time, the application composes the group HEADER before the group DETAIL. 
The group HEADER is a good place to identify the group. 
The group FOOTER, is composed after the group DETAIL. You can place a string saying "Total:" followed by a string 
variable which contains the field to be summed, with the SUM attribute. 
To create a group break: 
1. 
Click on the DETAIL band where you wish to add the break. 
2. 
From the IDE Menu, choose Report Designer Bands Surrounding Break.

This inserts the group BREAK. 
3. 
Click on the Break( ) just created. If the Property View is not visible, open it now from the 
IDE Menu (View Properties) 
 
4. 
In the Break Properties dialog, type the name of a variable or field, including the prefix, 
to break on in the Variable property. 
5. 
Type a valid Clarion label in the Label property to name the break. 
When the report prints, it groups all records with the same value for the BREAK field, as well as the group HEADER and 
## FOOTER.
 
If the break variable is a global or local variable, you must be sure that the executable code updates its value, so that it 
can generate a group BREAK.

Report Form Properties 
To specify a static page element which prints on every page, place it in the FORM. This is a free-floating section which 
can overlap the other sections. 
Use the FORM as a layer, to 'hold' graphic frames or preprinted forms into which the data from the other sections 'fit.' 
Another use for the FORM is to hold a 'watermark,' which prints underneath the report. 
The FORM size defaults to the same size as the page, less the margins. 
The print engine composes the FORM at the beginning of the print job; and does not update it thereafter. Therefore, the 
FORM is not suitable for holding variable data fields, or even a page number. You can, however, print fields from a control 
file, if you wish to print the same field contents on every page of the report. 
 
For best results when using a drawing tool to create a 'watermark,' on, for example, a 300 DPI printer, set the fill for the 
watermark element to 10% gray, or light gray. At higher printing resolutions, try 20% gray. 
The FORM should guide the user to the data. You might use lines and boxes, for example, to divide the DETAIL into 
'compartments,' grouping data and columns for the user. You may even create a 'greenbar paper' effect by alternating 
gray or light green color blocks.

Report Designer Menu Commands 
  
The Report Designer helps you visually design report elements--variable strings and other controls--on screen. The 
Report Designer automatically generates and places the language structures and source code that describe these 
elements in your .APP file or source code document. 
The Report Designer menu is visible during any Designer session, and provides populating controls options and 
alignment commands for spacing and sizing the controls within the window. You may place two or more controls so that 
their 'edges' match up with each other. You may also spread the controls out, or make all of them the same size. 
To do so, first select two or more controls. Select the first by clicking on it. Select the second and subsequent controls by 
pressing the CTRL key, then clicking on the second control while the shift key remains pressed.  
Lasso multiple controls by CTRL+CLICK+DRAGGING to form a box around the controls. 
Duplicate a control by first selecting it, and then press the F2 key or CTRL + DRAG.

Report Properties 
This dialog lets you set up the basic report options, including its page orientation, measurement units, margins, and paper 
size.  
Color 
Enter a valid color equate in the TextColor or BackGround fields, or press the ellipsis (...) button to select a color from 
the Color dialog. The Report Designer adds the COLOR attribute to your report declaration. 
See ..\LIBSRC\EQUATES.CLW for a list of valid color equates. See Windows Design Issues in the User's Guide for a 
discussion on using color to enhance your application. 
  
Design 
Locked 
"Freezes" all the controls on the report so that subsequent data dictionary 
changes are not applied. You can override the #Freeze attribute for all 
controls or for individual controls. See Application Options. 
Extra 
Preview 
Specifies the name of a QUEUE which stores the filename(s) (*.WMF) for 
the metafile(s) generated for page preview. See the PREVIEW attribute. If 
you are using the Report Template, it is handled automatically if you check 
the Print Preview box and you should leave this entry blank. 
General 
Jobname 
Names the print job, as listed in the Windows Print Manager application. 
Label 
Type a valid Clarion label to name the REPORT data structure. 
Landscape 
Specifies landscape paper orientation. New reports default to portrait 
mode. Landscape means the report text is aligned parallel with the 
longest paper edges. 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of the report controls. Left to Right maintains 
the original layout specified in the Report Designer. Default field 
navigation moves from left to right. Right to Left essentially "flips" the 
report controls’ display as a mirror image of the layout specified in the 
Report Designer. 
Paper-Type 
Choose from over 40 standard sizes, or choose Other to specify a 
custom size. 
Width 
Specifies a custom paper width in units specified on the General tab.  
Height 
Specifies a custom paper height in units specified on the General tab. 
Prefix 
Specifies the label prefix for the REPORT structure.

TextFont 
To set the default font for all controls appearing in the report, press the 
Font button, then choose the font and style in the Font dialog. You may 
override the default by setting a different font in the Properties dialog for 
any specific control. The options you choose in the dialog become the 
parameters for the FONT attribute. As you choose options, the dialog box 
displays a sample of the formatting. 
Units 
Specifies the default measurement for all controls placed in the report. 
Choose Dialog Units, THOUSandths of Inches, MilliMeters or POINTS.  
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the report detail print area, by filling in the AT attribute. The measurement units for 
these boxes are specified on the General tab. 
To set a precise starting point for your print detail area relative to the top left corner of the paper, specify Top Left Corner 
coordinates with this dialog. In effect, this establishes the left margin for your report. The top margin is usually determined 
by the Page Header position. These settings may also be accomplished visually by dragging report sections and borders 
in the Report Designer's Page Layout View. 
To set the size of the print detail area, choose from the following options for the Width and Height. When changing a 
report from portrait to landscape, or vice versa, you should also change the width and height on this tab. 
Default 
Sets a value based on the Paper Type property. 
Value 
To set a specific size, mark the Value choices.

ReportWriter 
 
ReportWriter for Clarion Win32 
ReportWriter for Clarion Win32 is installed in the \Clarion7%ROOT%\ReportWriter directory.  
It can be accessed within the IDE from the Tools menu, or externally from a shortcut in your Start Menu Program Group. 
Importing Dictionary Information 
ReportWriter works with the Clarion Dictionary’s TXD format.  
You can export your Clarion7 DCT to TXD format by choosing Export to text in the DCT Explorer toolbar. When saving, 
change the extension to .TXD in the Save File dialog  
 
The Clarion Win32 dictionary support for TXD export is provided solely for compatibility with Report Writer and is "export 
only". Except for use with ReportWriter you should use the new DCTX XML format when working in Clarion Win32. You 
cannot import a .TXD file created in Clarion Win32, and an error is reported if you attempt to do so. 
More information regarding ReportWriter in general can be found in the ReportWriter core help file included in this Clarion 
Win32 install.

XML Documentation Comments 
 
  
This type of comment provides the ability to generate XML documentation for Clarion .Net source files. (For more 
information see XML Documentation in MSDN). All comments started with "!!!" are considered as documentation 
comments.  
  
Example:  
  
!!!<summary>  
!!! This is a class A  
!!!</summary>  
## A  CLASS
    …  
   END  
  
Quick XML Documentation 
The Quick XML Documentation feature is only available in Clarion.NET. 
To write a documentation comment to any target object, start the comment with 3 exclamation marks: 
  
For example: 
  
!!! <summary> 
!!! Special Formatting Documentation 
!!! </summary> 
!!! <param name="b">The parameter comment</param> 
!!! <remarks> 
!!! This is a remark. 
!!! </remarks> 
class.proc  procedure(long b) 
   code 
  
If you use XML-styled documentation comment syntax (as in the above example) you will see special formatting in the 
tooltip text provided by the Code Completion. Otherwise, the comments will be displayed in the tooltip "as is".  
Documentation comments must precede the object declaration. For procedures, you can have comments for the 
procedure declaration or procedure definition (the comment for declaration has higher priority).

IDE Reference

Other examples: 
  
test  long !comment to test 
test1 long 
In the example above, test1 will have a "comment to test" documentation comment. The test variable will not, since it 
comes before the test1 variable declaration. 
  
! comment1 
c class 
p procedure !proc comment 
end 
In this example, the p procedure will have no documentation comment, but the c class will display both comment lines 
comment1 and proc comment.

Expands all corners of the selected controls to the nearest grid point. 
Center 
Horizontally 
As a group (relative positions of selected controls don't change), centers 
the selected controls vertically within the window. 
Center Vertically 
As a group (relative positions of selected controls don't change), centers 
the selected controls horizontally within the window. 
 Additionally, there are other helper buttons located on the Alignment toolbar: 
 Bring to Front 
For overlapping controls, select this item to move the active control 
to the top. 
Send to Back 
For overlapping controls, select this item to move the active control

Tab Order 
This option lets you visually specify the tab-stop order of the 
controls in the window. A small box with a number inside appears 
on each control, indicating the current order. CLICK on the controls 
to change the order to the order you wish. To cancel the tab order 
change, simply right-click outside of the window area and toggle this 
item off. 
Parent/Child controls are marked with the following convention: 
parent control.child control.grand-child control 
For example, a STRING that is populated on a SHEET/TAB control 
may show 1.0.2. The second SHEET on the window, first TAB in 
that sheet, and the third control populated on that tab 
This feature uses the Microsoft Forms standard, where controls are 
number starting at control zero (0) as the first control. 
Print Preview 
Calls the Print Preview dialog. From here, you can review a file’s 
contents before printing (Report Designer only). 
Switch 
SuppressTransparency 
This button enables the design time SuppressTransparency 
property. The effect of this property is to allow the proper display of 
special static parent controls when populated "on top of" multiple 
tab controls. This property is set to TRUE by default, and ensures a 
proper display regardless of Visual Styles used. It has no effect on 
the actual runtime window display. 
Switch UseVisualStyles This button controls the display of Visual Styles for all valid controls 
in design mode (controls appear as if the XP manifest was active).

DrawGrid 
Set to True to display the design grid, or set to False to turn it off.  
GridSize 
Grid values are specified in dialog units, a unit of measure based on the current 
system font. Enter the horizontal and vertical grid size, separated by commas. 
Width is the horizontal distance between the grid dots (x axis). This is the 
minimum horizontal distance you can move a control when grid snap is on. 
Height is the vertical distance between the grid dots (y axis). This is the 
minimum vertical distance you can move a control when grid snap is on. 
Locked 
"Freezes" all the controls on the window so that subsequent data dictionary 
changes are not applied. You can override the #Freeze attribute for all controls or 
for individual controls. See Application Options. 
SnapToGrid 
Set to True to turn grid snap on; set to False to turn it off. Grid snap displays a 
dot grid of valid positioning coordinates and forces the upper left corner of new 
controls to align with the dot grid. The end user does not see the grid at run 
time; it is a design tool only. 
  
Extra 
Icon 
To associate an icon with the window, specify an icon in this field. You may type in 
a file name or an EQUATE. You may also press the ellipsis button (...), then select 
an icon file name using the standard Open File dialog. The file name or equate 
you specify becomes the parameter for the ICON attribute. 
You should always specify an icon for an application window. Specifying an icon 
name automatically places a minimize button on the caption bar of your 
application or MDI child window. 
Palette 
Use the PALETTE attribute to specify maximum color depth. The PALETTE 
attribute specifies how many colors you want this window to use when it is the 
foreground window. For example, 24-bit color would be 16777215. The number 
you specify becomes the parameter for the PALETTE attribute. Leave this field 
blank to specify the default for the end user's system.

Status Bar 
To provide a message bar at the bottom of your window, mark the Status Bar 
check box. This adds the STATUS attribute to the window. 
 
A status bar in an application window is an excellent way to increase user 
feedback in your application. Clarion makes it simple to post messages on the 
status bar advising the user of what your application is doing as it does it. 
Increasing user feedback makes the user feel more in control. This allows the 
user to feel more confident and be more efficient when using your application. 
Status 
Widths 
To set the width of the status bar zone(s), type a value or list of values in the 
Status Widths array field.  
You must set the Statusbar Status field to True to display a status bar. 
Press the ellipsis to access the INT32 Collection Editor. This dialog allows you to 
easily add additional status bar sections and their corresponding widths. 
The values you enter in this field fill the STATUS attribute parameters. 
The zones are the areas within the status bar marked off by the 3D shaded 
boxes. The first zone on the left, by default, displays MSG attribute text. This is 
useful for specifying short help instructions or other information to the user. If 
your application has only one zone for the status bar, you may omit this field. For 
more than one zone, enter additional array values.  
The default measurement unit is dialog units.You may set a minimum value for a 
zone width by typing a negative number. This creates a zone with a minimum 
width, but is expandable by resizing the window. Use the runtime property 
assignment syntax to place text in any zone. To place a string in the second 
zone, for example: 
{PROP:StatusText} = ?array 
 
A multi-zone status bar can give your application a professional look. You may 
display help text in zone one, and when editing a record, the current record 
number in zone two, for example. 
  
Timer 
To specify the window receive Timer Event messages from Windows, fill in the 
Timer field. Specify the timer interval in hundredths of seconds. The file name or 
equate you specify becomes the parameter for the TIMER attribute. 
For example, if you specify 100 in the field, the window will automatically receive 
an EVENT:Timer once every second (100/100's seconds). This might be 
appropriate for adding a clock to a status bar.

Frame Type 
To choose the frame for your window, pick a selection from the Frame 
Type drop-down list. The frame defines the borders of the window. The 
normal frame type for an application frame is the resizeable type. 
Choose from: 
  
Single – a single pixel frame which the user cannot resize. 
  
Double – a thick frame, which the user cannot resize. This adds the 
DOUBLE attribute to the window. 
  
Resizeable - a thick frame, which the user can resize. This adds the 
RESIZE attribute to the window. 
Initial Size 
Sets the initial state of your window. Choose from: 
  
Normal - displays the window at the default size which either you 
specifically set, or Windows sets if you don't. 
  
Maximized - the window fills the desktop, if an application window, or the 
window frame, if an MDI child window. This adds the MAXIMIZE attribute 
to the window. 
  
Iconized - the window appears in iconized state--as a 32 by 32 pixel 
window at the bottom of the desktop. This adds the ICONIZE attribute to 
the window.  
Label 
To specify the label for the application structure, type it in the Label field. 
This names the specific APPLICATION in the source code. The label may 
contain upper or lower case letters, numerals, the underscore character or 
a colon. Space characters are forbidden. The first character must be a 
letter or the underscore character. Clarion reserved words may not serve 
as labels. 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of window controls and field sequence. 
  
Left to Right maintains the original layout specified in the Window 
Designer. 
  
Default field navigation moves from left to right. 
  
Right to Left essentially "flips" the window controls’ display as a mirror 
image of the layout specified in the Window Designer. Default field 
navigation moves from right to left. 
  
The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting to all child 
window that have the default setting active. 
TextFont 
Calls the Select Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, 
style (such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and 
strikeout) for the selected control or window. As you choose options, the 
dialog box displays a sample of the selected font.

To provide a background image for the window's client area, specify an 
image filename. Type the filename or press the ellipsis button (...) to select 
a file. See WALLPAPER in the Language Reference. 
Mode 
Specify how the window displays the background image. Choose from: 
Stretched 
The image expands to fill the entire client area. 
Centered 
The image displays at its default size and is centered in the window's 
client area.

The image displays at its default size and is repeated so it fills the 
entire client area. 
  
Help 
Alert 
Press the ellipsis to open a dialog that lets you add the ALRT attribute to a 
window or control. When the attribute is set, the window generates an 
EVENT:AlertKey if the user presses the key(s) you specify in this dialog, 
while the window has the focus. 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. 
The drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog. 
Help ID 
The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be 
either a Help keyword or a context string.  
A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search 
for it in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a 
button, if the entry box has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file 
opens to the referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, 
the search dialog appears. 
When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it 
with a leading tilde (~). 
Key 
Press the desired key or key combination (for example, CTRL+H). The 
keys you pressed will appear in the Key field, and will be supplied as 
parameters to the KEY or ALRT attribute for this control. The ESC, 
ENTER, and TAB keys cannot be specified by pressing them. For these 
keys, press the ellipsis (...) button and type "esc," "enter," or "tab." 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in 
the first zone of the status bar when the control has focus.

Options 
AutoDisplay 
To add the AUTO attribute to your window, set AutoDisplay to True. This 
automatically updates the contents of all controls on screen through each 
pass of the ACCEPT loop. 
EntryPattern 
To enable support for an entry mask for controls in the window, set 
EntryPattern to True. This lets you specify key-in entry patterns for the 
fields you choose, and adds the MASK attribute to the window. 
Immediate 
To generate a message event each time the end user moves or resizes 
the window, set Immediate to True. This adds the IMM attribute to the 
window. You are responsible for the code that executes upon notification 
of the event. 
MaximizeBox 
To place a maximize button in your window, set MaximizeBox to True. In 
general, you should place a maximize button only on application windows 
and MDI child document windows. This adds the MAX attribute to the 
window. 
SystemMenu 
To add a system menu to your window, set SystemMenu to True. Most 
windows should have a system menu. For users on a system without a 
mouse, the system menu provides the only means of minimizing, 
maximizing or re-sizing the window. This adds the SYSTEM attribute to 
the window. 
 
Even if you plan that the window should NOT have a system menu when 
the application is complete, it's good practice to place a system menu on 
your application while it's under development. By DOUBLE-CLICKING 
the system menu, or choosing Close, you can close your application 
should your normal exit procedure fail. 
  
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of a window. 
Position lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the size visually by 
dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the window's Top Left Corner, choose from the following options for the X (horizontal) and Y 
(vertical) coordinates.  
Center 
Centers an APPLICATION window on the screen. Centers child windows on their 
respective parents. 
Default The Windows operating system determines the initial position of the window. By 
default, Windows position windows in a cascading sequence from top-left to bottom-
right. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise coordinate in Dialog units. Generally, the coordinate is relative to 
the top left corner of the screen for APPLICATION (first or main) windows and relative 
to the top left corner of the APPLICATION window for all subsequent (child) windows. 
To set the window's size, choose from the following options for the Width and Height.

Default The Windows operating system determines the initial size of the window. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units. Dialog units provide a relative 
screen measure based on the system font character size. 
  
Scrollbars 
To add a horizontal scroll bar to your window, set Horizontal to True. Scroll bars only appear when something inside the 
window--a control--is bigger than the window. To add a vertical scroll bar to your window, set Vertical to True. These 
options add the HSCROLL, VSCROLL, and HVSCROLL attributes to the window. 
Assuming your application frame will display MDI child windows, you normally set both Horizontal and Vertical.

List Box Formatter Dialog 
The List Box Formatter dialog shows how the list box under construction looks. It fills this sample list box with placeholder 
characters representing the contents of each field. If any field contains a header, a header row appears over the column. 
You format the fields one by one in the Properties dialog. The sample list box always displays a horizontal scroll bar, 
whether you specify one in the List Properties dialog or not. 
Select multilple columns for editing using CTRL + CLICK. You can also just use the keyboard. Hold the CTRL key and 
press the up or down arrow key. To unselect all items just release the Ctrl key and press the up or down arrow key. or 
release the CTRL key and mouse click on any column. 
The formatter does not display a vertical scroll bar. If the queue contains more items than rows in the list, and if you add 
the VSCROLL attribute by checking the box in the List Properties dialog, the vertical scroll bar appears at run time. 
The dialog contains the following buttons: 
 
Add Group 
 
To add a new Group, press the New Group button (or SHIFT+INS). This 
adds the currently highlighted column into the new group. Use the Move 
Column butttons to move other columns into (or out of) a group. 
Add Field 
 
To add a field to the list box, press the New Column button (or INS). 
When opening the List Box Formatter from within the Application 
Generator, using a procedure template which supports it, the Populate 
button displays the Select Field dialog. From here, you can indicate any 
database field or memory variable for use as a list box column. The 
generated code puts the contents of the database records into the queue 
for use in the list box. 
Remove 
 
Removes the currently selected field from the list box. 
Move Left 
 
(CTRL + LEFT ARROW) Moves the currently selected field one position 
to its left. If the selected field is the leftmost in a group, the field moves 
out of the group, without changing position. If the selected field is 
immediately to the right of a group, the field moves into the group, 
without changing position. 
Move Right 
 
(CTRL + RIGHT ARROW) Moves the currently selected field one 
position to its right. If the selected field is the rightmost in a group, the 
field moves out of the group, without changing position. If the selected

Data 
AutoFieldNumber 
This property provides support for the Field Number of a column, and the 
ability to override it. Set this proprty to True to designate that the field 
numbering of the selected column will be "standard", based on the order 
that it appears in the list box. Setting this property to False allows the 
field numbering to be modified. This feature is important for some list box 
properties that require field number information, and gives you the ability 
to control it. 
DataIndent 
Optionally specify an indent, in dialog units, for the listbox data. Indent 
moves the data by the number of dialog units specified, in the opposite 
direction to the justification. An indent of two (2) on left justified data 
improves listbox readability. The indent appears within the FORMAT 
string surrounded by parentheses and preceded by a letter indicating the 
justification, as in "L(8)." 
DataJustification 
Choose from the drop-down list to specify left, right, center or decimal. 
Decimal justification aligns decimal numbers by their decimal points. The 
justification appears in the FORMAT string following the data width, as in 
## "40R."

Set to True to specify that the column always remains visible in the listbox, even 
if other columns scroll. 
The FORMAT string includes the "F" character, immediately preceding the 
header text as in "F~MyHeader~." 
HasColor 
Set to True to allow conditional runtime colors for individual list items--that is, to 
conditionally override the default colors for individual list rows. The color 
information for each row is contained in four LONG fields that immediately 
follow the data field in the QUEUE. Assign the color value to the appropriate 
QUEUE field at runtime, and Clarion's runtime library does the rest. 
See Control Templates--BrowseBox Control for information on specifying 
conditional BrowseBox colors, and see FORMAT in the Language Reference. 
Adds an asterisk "*" to the FORMAT string. 
LastOnLine 
Set to True to specify that the next field in the group will appear immediately 
below the current field (if there are multiple fields in the first line of the group, 
the field will actually appear below the first field in the first line group). In effect, 
it stacks two or more fields below the group header. 
 
The field must be part of a group. 
 
For the best display, make sure that your window is not resizable when using 
multi-line groups. 
The FORMAT string includes the "/" character, immediately preceding the 
header text as in "/~MyHeader~." 
Locator 
By default, the first field in a multi-column COMBO displays in the entry portion 
of the COMBO. Set Locator to True to specify that this field (instead of the first 
field) displays in the entry box portion of a multi-column COMBO control.  
The FORMAT string includes the "?" character, immediately preceding the 
header text as in "?~MyHeader~."

Resizeable 
Set to True to specify that the user can resize the width of the columns at run 
time. 
The FORMAT string includes the "M" character, immediately preceding the 
header text as in "M~MyHeader~." 
See How to Restore User Resized List Box Column Widths... 
RightBorder 
Set to True to specify column separators between fields in the listbox at run 
time. 
The FORMAT string includes the pipe symbol ( | ), immediately preceding the 
header text, as in "|~MyHeader~." 
Style 
Set to True to allow conditional runtime fonts for individual list items--that is, to 
conditionally override the default fonts for individual list rows. The font (style) 
information for each row is contained in a LONG field that immediately follows 
the data field in the QUEUE. Assign the style value to the appropriate QUEUE 
field at runtime, and Clarion's runtime library does the rest. 
See Control Templates--BrowseBox Control in the Template Guide for 
information on specifying conditional BrowseBox colors, and see FORMAT in the 
Language Reference. 
Adds a "Y" to the FORMAT string. 
Tooltip 
Set to True to activate a specific tool tip for the selected column. The tool tip 
content is specified on the Appearance tab. Adds a "P" to the FORMAT string. 
 Before you can activate individual column tool tips, make sure that 
you have a tool tip defined for the list box control. This is found on the Help tab 
of the selected list box control. 
Underline 
Set to True to add the underline style to the listbox text. In effect, this creates a 
bottom border for each row in the column, giving your listbox a spreadsheet or 
cell-like appearance. 
The FORMAT string includes the underscore character, immediately preceding 
the header text, as in "_~My Header~."

Adds a "J" to the FORMAT string. 
  
Header 
Indent 
Optionally specify an indent, in dialog units, for the heading text. Indent moves 
the data by the number of dialog units specified, in the opposite direction to the 
justification. An indent of two (2) on left justification improves listbox readability.  
This appears within the FORMAT string following the header, as in "~My 
Header~L(8)." 
Justification 
Choose from the drop-down list to specify left, right, center or decimal header 
justification. 
This appears within the FORMAT string following the header, as in "~My 
Header~L." 
ScrollBar 
Type a non-zero value to specify a horizontal scroll bar for this column only. If 
the overall listbox already has a scroll bar, the column scroll bar appears above 
the listbox scroll bar. The value specifies, in dialog units, how far the column 
scrolls. 
For example, if your data is fifty (50) characters, and your listbox column width 
is about forty (40) characters (one hundred sixty (160) dialog units), you should 
specify a value of fifty (50). Fifty (50) additional dialog units are enough to 
display the ten characters that extend beyond the width of the listbox column. 
The scroll bar and size appear in the FORMAT string together, as in "S(4)." 
Text 
Optionally specify header text for the column. The header appears as a gray 
row above the listbox data items. To specify no header, leave this field blank. If 
any field included in the listbox has a header, a header appears across the 
entire listbox; fields with no header text have a blank header. 
The heading appears within the FORMAT string enclosed in tilde (~) characters, 
as in "~My Header~." 
Width 
Specify the width in dialog units for the column data. By default, the Formatter 
sets the value to four times the number of characters specified in the field 
picture in the data dictionary. For variables, the default is four times the number 
of characters in the picture token defined for it.

As a rough guide, allow four dialog units for an average character. For example, 
if you want a column 10 characters wide, type 40 in the Width field. 
After you've placed a field, you can drag the column separators in the Sample 
Listbox to resize the column width. The cursor changes when you place it on 
top of the separator, to indicate you can resize it. 
The data width you set appears within the FORMAT string for the field, 
preceding the Justification code, as in "40L."

It is not necessary to be concerned with the precise syntax of the List Box Format String. Always use the List Box 
Formatter to build the string for you. If you are using PROP:FORMAT in your embedded source, you can always cut and 
paste your format string from the Formatter as needed.

ListBox Styles 
A list box style is a collection of fonts and colors that control a list box appearance. Applying a style to a list box is a two-
step process. The style attribute must first be enabled for each desired column in the List Box Formatter. Next, a style can 
be applied in the Actions tab for each column in the list box control. The styles that are applied are maintained and 
organized in this window. 
This dialog provides update buttons to add, change or delete a selected list box style, and is accessed from the Listbox 
Styles button located on the Procedure Properties window. 
In the subsequent Styles dialog, the following prompts are provided: 
  
 
Each prompt that follows in this dialog has an optional "V" button that, when pressed, provides an ellipsis button for 
variable selection. This extends the power of listbox styles to allow a given style to be controlled and modified at runtime. 
  
Style Attributes 
A list box style contains the following attributes: 
  
Font 
Press the Font button to designate a Font Name (Arial, MS Sans Serif, 
etc.), Font Size, and Font Style (Regular, Bold, Italic, etc.) for the 
active listbox style. Manual entry of these settings is also permitted, but 
entering incorrect values (Font Names and Styles that are not 
supported) can produce unpredictable results. 
Color 
Press the appropriate ellipsis button to set the active style colors for a 
column’s Foreground Normal, Foreground Selected, Background 
Normal, and Background Selected display mode. 
Picture 
Press the ellipsis button to build a picture token, or enter a picture token 
in the entry field provided which will replace the default column picture. 
  
Runtime List Box 
The Runtime ListBox style option is used to generate the appropriate runtime property syntax for a selected style and a 
selected list box that is not associated with the default procedure template (i.e., a hand coded list box or a third party 
template that populates a list box). Select the list box to associate with the current active style.

List Format Manager - Procedure Level 
  
The List Format Manager dialog allows you to set the precise level of control for the runtime Format Manager. Special 
formatting of the list box can be controlled behind the scenes by program logic, or you can open up a special popup 
design interface that allows the users to create and modify unlimited list box format appearances. 
The following images show an example run time Format Manager interface: 
 
From the browse box, the user can right-click, and select a different format from the popup menu, or add a new format by 
selecting the List Format menu item. 
 
The list box above shows the Format Editor’s active list formats, and allows the user to add, change or delete them as 
needed.

IDE Reference 
315 
 
The user has the ability in the above Format Editor window to designate what fields (columns) to use in the new format, 
and move the field values up or down in order. 
Note: If you change the order that the columns are presented in the list box, each column MUST HAVE a specific column 
field number defined in the list box formatter (do not use the Auto option). See: Field Number  
The following prompts are presented: 
Popup Mode 
Choose Enable from the drop list to allow the user to access the Format Editor interface at runtime, or Disable to remove 
this menu item from the popup. 
 Format Editor Interface: 
Items Check Type 
Select Icons to allow a check box icon to appear to the right of the column selection interface. Selecting Text will give you 
a "Yes" displayed when a column is included in the format string. 
Items Sort By 
Select Alpha from the drop list to display all list formats in alphabetical order. Select Code to sort the list formats "as is", 
in the order that they are entered. 
Tool Tip 
Select Enable to allow tool tips to be displayed in the Format Editor.  
 Different Format for each Sort Order? 
Check this box if you would like to save a different list format for each active sort order defined (default and conditional). 
For example, a sort by account number may display a list format with the account number first, a sort by name may 
display a list format with the name first, etc.  
Append Sort Number to Menu item 
Each sort defined uses by default "Sort Order X" where X is equal to the sort number. If you are translating this text by 
overriding the Sort Order Menu item in the Global Properties, you can disable the sort number generation here. 
Save Format on Session? 
Check this box to allow users to save their current format changes when closing, and use that same format as the new 
default when the window is opened again.  
 
The destination of the saved changes is defined in the List Format Global Extension. You can specify that the application 
create a table to store the format changes, or you can specify an existing table in your data dictionary.

Menu Editor 
The Menu Editor dialog visually represents a Clarion MENUBAR data structure. The menu tree (on the left hand side of 
the dialog) appears as simplified Clarion language syntax, containing these Clarion keywords: 
A MENUBAR keyword at the top. 
A MENU statement or statements followed by a menu name, and a corresponding END statement. 
An ITEM statement or statements followed by an item name. 
Menu Editor command buttons allow you to add and delete MENUs and ITEMs. You may also move MENUs and ITEMs 
within the MENUBAR structure with the "up arrow" and "down arrow" buttons. 
The right hand side of the dialog lets you specify the text of your MENUs and ITEMs, the equate labels used to reference 
the MENUs and ITEMs in executable code, and the actions that occur when the user selects an ITEM. 
 
When using the Application Generator, each ITEM you place on a MENU or MENUBAR automatically adds an embed 
point to the control event handling tree in the Embedded Source dialog. This lets you easily attach functionality to your 
ITEMs. 
  
Menu Editor Buttons 
New Menu 
## (SHIFT+INSERT)
 
This button adds a new MENU statement, its Menu Text, and its 
corresponding END statement. The MENU is added after the 
highlighted line. MENUs may be nested within other menus. MENUs 
may contain MENUs or ITEMs. 
New Item 
## (INSERT)
 
This button inserts an ITEM after the highlighted line. Note that ITEMs 
are used to execute commands or procedures, whereas MENUs are 
used to display a selection of other MENUs or ITEMs. 
New Separator 
## (CTRL+INSERT)
 
To add a separator bar after the currently highlighted MENU or ITEM, 
press the Separator button. 
 
Separator bars can provide the user with a visual cue that a group of 
ITEMs on the menu perform related functions. 
Delete Menu/Item 
Button 
## (DELETE)
 
To delete the currently highlighted MENU, ITEM, or SEPARATOR, 
press the Delete button. If you delete a MENU statement, all ITEMs 
and MENUs within it, and its associated END statement are also 
deleted. 
Move Buttons 
(CTRL+UP Arrow) 
(CTRL+Down Arrow) 
 
 
To move the currently highlighted MENU, ITEM, or SEPARATOR up 
or down in the menu list, press the  or ¯ button. When moving a 
MENU, all ITEMs and MENUs within it, and its associated END 
statement move also.

Check 
To create an on/off toggle for a selected ITEM, set the Check property to True. 
The ITEM should have a numeric variable in the Use field. The variable should 
be declared using one of the data dialogs, or in embedded source. The Menu 
Editor adds the CHECK attribute to this ITEM.  
With the CHECK attribute, when the user selects the ITEM for the first time, the 
ITEM is "on," the Use Variable's value is one (1), and a check mark appears 
beside the ITEM. When the user selects the ITEM a second time, the ITEM is 
"off," the Use Variable's value is zero (0) and no check mark is displayed. You 
should add source code to control the application's behavior depending on the 
state of the Use Variable. 
Disable 
To disable a MENU or ITEM (dim the text and make it unavailable to the user), 
set Disable to True. This adds the DISABLE attribute to the MENU or ITEM 
statement. 
 
The Disable box is handy when you incorporate modality into a program--that is, 
when one type of child window does not support the same commands another 
type does. For the type that doesn't support the command, disable the ITEM 
rather than omitting it. This will avoid confusing the user with menu ITEMs that 
disappear and reappear depending on which window is active. 
Right 
To right justify the selected MENU on the action bar, set Right to True. This is 
available only for MENUs on the action bar. Nested MENUs (subMENUs) 
cannot be right justified. Checking this box displays the selected MENU, and all 
MENUs after the selected MENU, at the far right of the action bar. 
  
Color 
Enter a valid color equate in the TextColor or BackColor fields, or press the ellipsis (...) button to select a color from the 
Color dialog. The Window Designer adds the COLOR attribute to your MENU or ITEM declaration. 
  
General 
NoMerge 
To tell Clarion never to merge this MENUBAR with other MENUBARs, set 
the No Merge to True. This is available only for the MENUBAR, not for 
MENUs or ITEMs. See the Language Reference for more information on 
the NOMERGE attribute. 
Text 
Type the text you want displayed for this MENU or ITEM. For example, 
type &FILE, so the end user sees File. The ampersand within the Menu 
Text field signifies the character following the ampersand is the 
accelerator key. That is, the character is underlined, and, when the user 
presses the accelerator key, the action associated with the ITEM is 
executed. 
 
A MENU accelerator key requires THE ALT key to take effect, whereas an 
ITEM accelerator key does not require the ALT key, but does require that 
the ITEM be currently displayed. See Hot Key below for another method 
of accessing your MENUs and ITEMs.

TextFont 
Calls the Font dialog which lets you change the font (typeface), size, style 
(such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and strikeout) for 
the selected MENU or ITEM As you choose options, the dialog box 
displays a sample of the selected font. 
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. Type a Field Equate Label. 
A Field Equate Label has a leading question mark ( ? ), and you should 
make it descriptive. For example ?File shows this menu is to manipulate a 
file. You can refer to the MENU within executable code by its Field Equate 
Label. 
Icon  
Specify the ICON you want displayed for this MENU or ITEM.  
Std 
To specify a standard windows action for your menu ITEM, select one of 
the equates listed below in the Std field. Clarion will automatically 
implement the command using standard windows behavior; you do not 
need any other support for it in your code. The standard equate labels 
and their associated actions are also contained in the 
..\LIBSRC\EQUATES.CLW file. 
STD:PrintSetup

Position First 
To force the selected MENU or ITEM to the first position when merging 
menus, set this property to True. This adds the FIRST attribute to the 
MENU or ITEM statement. 
Position Last  
To force the menu or item to the last position when merging menus, set this 
property to True. This adds the LAST attribute to the MENU or ITEM 
statement.  
LeftOffset 
Specify the level of indention for the MENU or ITEM (in dialog units). This 
sets the parameter for the LEFT attribute. 
AT (Height and 
Width) 
Control the height and width of the selected menu or item

Default 
If set to True, the Clarion runtime library determines the size based on the 
applicable font and text value. 
Value 
When Default is set to False, Value lets you set a precise width or height 
in Dialog units on a window. 
  
Help 
HelpID 
Type either a help keyword or a context string present in a .HLP file. 
If you fill in the Help ID for a MENU or an ITEM, when the user highlights 
the MENU or ITEM and presses the F1 key, the help file opens to the 
referenced topic. 
The Help ID field (HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in a Windows Help file. This may be 
either a Help keyword or a context string. When referencing a context 
string in the Help ID field, you must identify it with a leading tilde (~). 
Key 
Press this button to open the Input Key dialog. Use this dialog to add the 
KEY attribute to your MENU or ITEM. The KEY attribute specifies a "hot" 
key or key combination. 
A hot key is very similar to an accelerator key. A hot key or hot key 
combination allows the end user to immediately display a MENU, or 
execute the action associated with an ITEM, without mouse clicking, and 
without displaying the menu that contains the ITEM. Customarily, hot 
keys take the form of CTRL + character, or CTRL + SHIFT + character. 
 
You may want to add the hot key combination to the menu text to signal 
its availability to the user. See the Windows Design appendix in the 
User's Guide for a list of common hot keys associated with standard 
windows commands. 
Message 
Type the MSG attribute contents. 
This message text displays in the status bar (if enabled) when the user 
highlights this MENU or ITEM. 
  
Mode 
Hide 
Specifies that the menu or item does not appear when the WINDOW or 
APPLICATION is first opened. UNHIDE must be used to display the 
target menu or item. 
  
Actions (CTRL + A) 
Use the Actions properties to add functionality to your menu item. Filling in these prompts causes the menu item to 
execute an action when the user selects the menu item.

Classes 
Many of the ABC Procedure, Control and Extension templates provide a Classes tab or dialog. These local Classes tabs 
let you control the classes (and objects) your procedure uses to accomplish the template's task—that is, they override the 
global class settings specified in the Global Properties dialog. You may accept the default Application Builder Class 
specified in the Global Properties dialog (recommended), or you may specify your own or a third party class to override 
the default setting. Deriving your own class can give you very fine control over the procedure when the standard 
Application Builder Class is not precisely what you need. 
Object Name 
Set the object's label for the template generated code. 
Use Default Application Builder Class? 
Check this box to use the default Application Builder Class specified in the Global Properties dialog. Clear this box to 
use a class other than the default, and to enable the following prompts. 
Use Application Builder Class? 
Check this box to select a class from the Base Class drop-down list. The list includes all classes with the LINK attribute in 
\LIBSRC\*.INC files. Clear this box to specify a class declared elsewhere.

Base Class If you checked the Use Application Builder Class? box, select a class from the drop-down list. If you 
cleared the Use Application Builder Class? box, type the class label here, and type the name of the source file that 
contains the class declaration in the Include File entry box. 
Include File If you cleared the Use Application Builder Class? box, type the class label in the Base Class entry box, 
and type the name of the source file that contains the class declaration here. 
Derive? 
Check this box to derive a class based on the parent class specified above and to enable the New Class Methods and 
New Class Properties buttons to define any new properties and methods for the derived class.  
This prompt is primarily to allow you to define new properties and methods in a derived class. To override existing 
methods, simply embed code in the corresponding method embed points. 
Using Derive?, New Class Methods and New Class Properties makes the template generate code similar to the 
following: 
    MyProcess CLASS(Process)  !derive a class from the parent class 
    NewMethod  PROCEDURE    !prototype new class method 
    NewProperty BYTE      !declare new class property 
         END 
 
The template automatically derives from the parent class if you embed code into any of the derived method embed points, 
regardless of the status of this check box.  
New Class Methods 
Press this button to specify the new method prototypes to generate into the derived CLASS structure. This opens the New 
Class Methods dialog (see New Class Methods). 
New Class Properties 
Press this button to specify the new property declarations to generate into the derived CLASS structure. This opens the 
New Class Properties dialog (see New Class Properties).  
Application Builder Class Viewer 
Press this button to display classes, properties, and methods used by the ABC Templates, and the relationships between 
parent and derived (child) classes. This utility can help you analyze and understand the classes that the ABC Templates 
use. 
Refresh Application Builder Class Information 
Press this button if you have changed the contents of an include file (.INC) or added an include file to the \LIBSRC 
directory. Typically, this is needed when you install third party products that use ABC compliant classes, although you 
may create your own ABC compliant classes too. See ABC Compliant Classes for more information.The ABC Templates 
use information gleaned from the header files for generating embed points, loading the Application Builder Class Viewer, 
application conversion, etc. 
Composite Class 
Press these buttons to open a Classes dialog for each class used by the parent class specified above. For example, the 
WindowManager uses a Toolbar class, so the WindowManager's Classes dialog contains a Toolbar Class button to open 
a Classes dialog for its Toolbar Class.

Window Designer Menu Commands 
The Structure (Window) Designer helps you visually design Window elements--windows and controls--on screen. The 
Window Designer automatically generates and places the language structures and source code that describe these 
elements in your application (.APP) file or source code document. See Also: How to Customize Your Window 
The Window Designer IDE is comprised of several elements. Each of these is described in the following links: 
  
Control Toolbox  
Property Window  
Alignment Toolbar  
  
 
  
Popup (right-click) Menu 
The popup menu provides quick and easy access to a subset of the Edit menu commands. 
  
  
Bring to Front 
For overlapping controls, select this item to move the active control to the 
top. 
Send to Back 
For overlapping controls, select this item to move the active control to the 
back. 
Format 
Calls a sub-menu with all of the supported alignment functions 
Show Tab Order 
This option lets you visually specify the tab-stop order of the controls in 
the window. A small box with a number inside appears on each control, 
indicating the current order. CLICK on the controls to change the order to 
the order you wish. To cancel the tab order change, simply right-click 
outside of the window area and toggle this item off. 
Parent/Child controls are marked with the following convention: 
parent control.child control.grand-child control 
For example, a STRING that is populated on a SHEET/TAB control may 
show 1.0.2. The second SHEET on the window, first TAB in that sheet, 
and the third control populated on that tab. 
This feature uses the Microsoft Forms standard, where controls are 
number starting at control zero (0) as the first control. 
  
Lock Controls 
This option locks all controls to their current position. A "locked" icon 
appears in the upper left area of the control. When a control is locked, it 
may not be moved or resized. 
Select Template 
In the Application Generator Designer, this option selects the control and 
any other controls associated with this template.

Project, Build, Debug, Search and Tools Menus 
These menu items contained in these menus are not directly applicable to the Structure Designer. 
  
Window Designer Menu 
The Window Designer menu is visible during any Designer session, and provides populating controls options and 
alignment commands for spacing and sizing the controls within the window. You may place two or more controls so that 
their 'edges' match up with each other. You may also spread the controls out, or make all of them the same size. 
To do so, first select two or more controls. Select the first by clicking on it. Select the second and subsequent controls by 
pressing the CTRL key, then clicking on the second control while the shift key remains pressed.  
Lasso multiple controls by CTRL+CLICK+DRAGGING to form a box around the controls. 
  
Populate Menu: 
The menu options here allow you to quickly "populate" a window with entry controls and prompts for columns in your data 
dictionary table. Choose the Column Option for a single column population, or Multiple to recusively use this dialog.

Window Designer Options 
The Window Designer Options dialog sets the default position and size values applied when auto-populating controls, or 
when aligning controls with the alignment tools. To access the dialog, choose Setup Window Designer Options from 
the environment menu, or choose Tools Options from the Window Designer menu. The dialog is divided into four 
sections or tabs: Grid, Populate Defaults, Margin Defaults, and Spread Defaults. 
 
In order for some Window Designer settings to take effect, you may need to restart the IDE. 
Grid 
This tab turns grid snap on or off, and sets the starting point and offsets of the window grid. It also lets you show or hide 
the screen boundaries (extents) for the most common video resolutions (640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, etc.).  
You can use the grid to force the boundaries of your window controls to fall only on certain x / y values (axis, latitude, 
longitude). By enforcing the grid axis, your controls are easier to position and align. 
Snap to Grid 
Set to True to turn grid snap on; set to False to turn it off. Grid snap displays a dot grid of valid positioning coordinates 
and forces the upper left corner of new controls to align with the dot grid. The end user does not see the grid at run time; it 
is a design tool only. 
 
You can also choose View  Show Grid from the menu, or press the button to toggle grid snap on and off. 
Horizontal 
Enter the horizontal distance between the grid dots (x axis). This is the minimum horizontal distance you can move a 
control when grid snap is on. 
Vertical 
Enter the vertical distance between the grid dots (y axis). This is the minimum vertical distance you can move a control 
when grid snap is on. 
Origin X 
Enter the horizontal coordinate at which to begin placing the grid dots. This is the left-most position at which controls will 
align or auto-populate when grid snap is on. 
Origin Y 
Enter the vertical coordinate at which to begin placing the grid dots. This is the top-most position at which controls will 
align or auto-populate when grid snap is on. 
 
All the grid values are specified in dialog unitsa unit of measure based on the current system font. See the Glossary for a 
complete definition. 
Show Screen Extents 
Check this box to show video screen boundaries within the Window Designer for the most common video resolutions. 
Clear the box to suppress the boundaries. 
Snap on Resize 
Check this box to force controls to snap to the nearest grid point grid when resizing from the right or bottom edges. This 
constrains a controls width and height to the grid. Resizing a control using the top and left edges always snaps to the grid. 
Populate 
This tab sets the default width and height for a variety of window controls. The Window Designer applies the default sizes 
whenever you use it to add a control to the window. 


---

IDE Reference 
337 
Control Type 
Choose the type of control for which to set the default size. 
  
 
The default sizes are specified in dialog units, a unit of measure based on the current system font. See the Glossary for a 
complete definition. 
Default Width 
Set the default width for the specified control type. A value of zero (0) specifies no width; the control expands to the size of 
the data it displays. See AT in the Language Reference for more information. 
Use most common width already present 
Check this box to specify a dynamic default based on width of any controls of the same type that are already present on 
the window. For example, if there are three ENTRY controls and two of the controls are 50 units wide, then 50 becomes 
the default width for ENTRY controls. Clear this box to always apply the Default Width value, even if other controls of the 
same type are present. 
Default Height 
Set the default height for the specified control type. A value of zero (0) specifies no height; the control expands to the size 
of the data it displays. See AT in the Language Reference for more information. 
Use most common height already present 
Check this box to specify a dynamic default based on height of any controls of the same type that are already present on 
the window. For example, if there are three ENTRY controls and two of the controls are 10 units wide, then 10 becomes 
the default height for ENTRY controls. Clear this box to always apply the Default Height value, even if other controls of the 
same type are present. 
Margins 
This tab sets the margins applied by the margin alignment tool. For more information on these alignment tools, see 
Window Designer Tools. The margin is simply the distance between the closest edges of two controls (or of a control and 
the window). The Window Designer applies the margins whenever you use the margin alignment tools. 
Different types of controls require different margins to accommodate their unique characteristics. For example, TAB 
controls and GROUP controls need extra space to allow for their text. 
Container Type 
Choose the type of control for which to set the margins. Choose from: 
Window 
Set the default margins. 
Group 
Set the margins to apply for controls inside a GROUP control, abutting the GROUP control. 
Option 
Set the margins to apply for controls inside an OPTION control, abutting the OPTION control. 
Tab 
Set the margins to apply for controls inside a TAB control, abutting the TAB control. 
Top Margin 
The distance between the top edge of the selected control and the nearest horizontal edge of a bounding control or 
window. 
Side Margins 
The distance between the vertical edges of the selected control and the nearest vertical edge of a bounding control or 
window. 


---

IDE Reference 
338 
Bottom Margin 
The distance between the bottom edge of the selected control and the nearest horizontal edge of a bounding control or 
window. 
 
The two settings (Full and Thin) provide alternative margins applied by the margin alignment tools. For more information 
on these alignment tools, see Window Designer Tools. 
 
The default sizes are specified in dialog units, a unit of measure based on the current system font. See the Glossary for a 
complete definition. 
Spread 
This tab sets the default spacing between auto-populated window controls and between controls positioned by the Spread 
Alignment tools. The Window Designer applies the default spacing when you auto-populate fields from the Fields Toolbox 
and when you use the Spread Alignment tools. For more information on these alignment tools, see Window Designer 
Tools. 
Button Spacing 
Set the default distance between the edges of a button control and the nearest control. 
Other Control Spacing 
Set the default distance between the edges of two adjacent controls. 
Prompt to Field Spacing 
Set the default distance between the right edge of a PROMPT control and the left edge of its (visually) associated 
(ENTRY, SPIN, TEXT, etc.) control. 
 
The default sizes are specified in dialog units, a unit of measure based on the current system font. See the Glossary for a 
complete definition. 
Multiple control alignments 
This selection applies only to the Spread Alignment tools. For more information on these alignment tools, see Window 
Designer Tools. 
Use fixed spacing 
Apply the static values specified above when spacing (spreading) multiple controls. 
Calculate spacing 
Calculate spacing based on distance between first and last control, so there is an equal distance between each control.

Window Properties 
This dialog lets you specify the appearance and functionality of your window. 
  
Color 
Enter a valid color equate in the TextColor, Background, SelBackground, or SelForeground fields, or press the ellipsis 
(...) button to select a color from the Color dialog. The Window Designer adds the COLOR attribute to your window 
declaration. 
See ..\LIBSRC\EQUATES.CLW for a list of valid color equates. See Windows Design Issues in the User's Guide for a 
discussion on using color to enhance your application. 
Custom Color dialog 
For each property that requires a color attribute, there is a drop list that displays a variety of default colors to select from. 
However, if you need to choose a custom color, select the Custom tab, and RIGHT-CLICK on any color element in the 
bottom two rows of this dialog. 
  
Design 
Design options control the cosmetic settings in the Designer. 
DrawGrid 
Set to True to display the design grid, or set to False to turn it off.  
GridSize 
Grid values are specified in dialog units, a unit of measure based on the current 
system font. Enter the horizontal and vertical grid size, separated by commas. 
Width is the horizontal distance between the grid dots (x axis). This is the 
minimum horizontal distance you can move a control when grid snap is on. 
Height is the vertical distance between the grid dots (y axis). This is the 
minimum vertical distance you can move a control when grid snap is on. 
Locked 
"Freezes" all the controls on the window so that subsequent data dictionary 
changes are not applied. You can override the #Freeze attribute for all controls or 
for individual controls. See Application Options. 
SnapToGrid 
Set to True to turn grid snap on; set to False to turn it off. Grid snap displays a 
dot grid of valid positioning coordinates and forces the upper left corner of new 
controls to align with the dot grid. The end user does not see the grid at run 
time; it is a design tool only. 
  
Extra 
Drop ID 
To specify the type of Drag operations this control will accept, type up to 16 
signatures, separated by commas. The Window Designer adds the DROPID 
attribute to the control, which indicates the control is a valid target for the drag 
and drop operations identified by the signatures.

IDE Reference 
340 
 
Icon 
To associate an icon with the window, allowing it to be minimized, specify an icon 
in this field. You may type in a file name or an EQUATE. You may also press the 
ellipsis button (...), then select an icon file name using the standard Open File 
dialog. The file name or equate you specify becomes the parameter for the ICON 
attribute. 
You should always specify an icon for an application window, and for an MDI 
child window. Specifying an icon name automatically places a minimize button 
on the caption bar of your application or MDI child window. 
Palette 
Use the PALETTE attribute to specify maximum color depth. The PALETTE 
attribute specifies how many colors you want this window to use when it is the 
foreground window. For example, 24-bit color would be 16777215. The number 
you specify becomes the parameter for the PALETTE attribute. Leave this field 
blank to specify the default for the end user's system. 
Statusbar-
Status 
To provide a message bar at the bottom of your window, set the Status property 
to True. This adds the STATUS attribute to the window. 
 
A status bar in an application window is an excellent way to increase user 
feedback in your application. Clarion makes it simple to post messages on the 
status bar advising the user of what your application is doing as it does it. 
Increasing user feedback makes the user feel more in control. This allows the 
user to feel more confident and be more efficient when using your application. 
Widths 
To set the width of the status bar zone(s), type a value or list of values in the 
Status Widths field. You must also check the Status Bar box in the top part of 
the dialog to display a status bar. 
The values you enter in this field fill the STATUS attribute parameters. For 
example, To create a two part status bar with a width of 100 in the right status 
section and default width in the left section enter the values ‘-1,100’ 
The zones are the areas within the status bar marked off by the 3D shaded 
boxes. The first zone on the left, by default, displays MSG attribute text. This is 
useful for specifying short help instructions or other information to the user. If 
your application has only one zone for the status bar, you may omit this field. 
For more than one zone, enter a series of comma separated values. The default 
measurement unit is dialog units. 
You may set a minimum value for a zone width by typing a negative number. 
This creates a zone with a minimum width, but is expandable by resizing the 
window. Use the runtime property assignment syntax to place text in any zone. 
To place a string constant in the second zone, for example: 
{PROP:StatusText,2} = 'Record will be Added' 
 
A multi-zone status bar can give your application a professional look. You may 
display help text in zone one, and when editing a record, the current record 
number in zone two, for example.

IDE Reference 
341 
 
Timer 
To have the window receive Timer Event messages from Windows, fill in the 
Timer field. Specify the timer interval in hundredths of seconds. The value you 
specify becomes the parameter for the TIMER attribute. 
For example, if you specify 100 in the field, the window will automatically 
receive an EVENT:Timer once every second (100/100's seconds). This might 
be appropriate for adding a clock to a status bar. 
  
General 
Frame Type 
To choose the frame for your window, pick a selection from the Frame 
Type drop-down list. The frame defines the borders of the window. 
Choose from: 
  
Single - a single pixel frame which the user cannot resize. Most suitable 
for dialog boxes. 
  
Double - a thick frame, which the user cannot resize. Use this type frame 
for a system modal window with no caption bar, or for a modal dialog box 
with a caption bar. This adds the DOUBLE attribute to the window. 
  
Resizeable - a thick frame, which the user can resize. Choose this for 
application and MDI child windows. This adds the RESIZE attribute to the 
window. 
Initial Size 
Sets the initial state of your window. Choose from: 
  
Normal:- displays the window at the default size which either you 
specifically set, or Windows sets if you don't. 
  
Maximized: - the window fills the desktop, if an application window, or the 
window frame, if an MDI child window. This adds the MAXIMIZE attribute 
to the window. 
  
Iconized: - the window appears in iconized state--as a 32 by 32 pixel 
window at the bottom of the desktop, for an application window, or at the 
inside bottom of the application frame, for an MDI child window. This adds 
the ICONIZE attribute to the window. 
Label 
This names the specific WINDOW in the source code. The label may 
contain upper or lower case letters, numerals, the underscore character 
or a colon. Space characters are forbidden. The first character must be a 
letter or the underscore character. Clarion reserved words may not serve 
as labels.

IDE Reference 
342 
 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of window controls and field sequence. 
Left to Right maintains the original layout specified in the Window 
Designer. 
Default field navigation moves from left to right. 
Right to Left essentially "flips" the window controls’ display as a mirror 
image of the layout specified in the Window Designer. Default field 
navigation moves from right to left. 
The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting to all child 
window that have the Default setting active. 
TextFont 
Calls the Select Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, 
style (such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and 
strikeout) for the selected control or window. As you choose options, the 
dialog box displays a sample of the selected font. 
Title 
To specify caption bar text, type a string constant in the Title field. The 
caption bar holds the name of the window. 
  
 
You may dynamically alter the caption bar text at run-time. See 
PROP:Text in the Language Reference. 
Wallpaper-
BackgroundImage 
To provide a background image for the window's client area, specify an 
image filename. Type the filename or press the ellipsis button (...) to select 
a file. See WALLPAPER in the Language Reference. 
Mode 
Specify how the window displays the background image. Choose from: 
Stretched 
The image expands to fill the entire client area. 
Centered 
The image displays at its default size and is centered in the window's 
client area. 
Tiled 
The image displays at its default size and is repeated so it fills the 
entire client area. 
  
Help 
Alert 
Press the ellipsis to open a dialog that lets you add the ALRT attribute to a 
window or control. When the attribute is set, the window generates an 
EVENT:AlertKey if the user presses the key(s) you specify in this dialog, 
while the window has the focus.

IDE Reference 
343 
 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. 
The drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog. 
Help ID 
The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be 
either a Help keyword or a context string.  
A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search 
for it in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a 
button, if the entry box has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file 
opens to the referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, 
the search dialog appears. 
When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it 
with a leading tilde (~). 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in 
the first zone of the status bar when the control has focus. 
  
  
Misc 
IsSuppress 
Transparency 
 
Allows the proper display of special static parent controls when 
populated "on top of" multiple tab controls. This property is set to TRUE 
by default, and ensures a proper display regardless of Visual Styles 
used. No effect on runtime window. 
  
Options: 
AutoDisplay 
To add the AUTO attribute to your window, set the AutoDisplay property 
to True. This automatically updates the contents of all controls on screen 
through each pass of the ACCEPT loop. 
Docking 
The options in the Dock property group are enabled only if you have set 
the Toolbox property to True. Click on a location to specify the area that 
the window is allowed to be docked to within the application frame. 
The InitialState property drop list is used to specify where you would like 
the window to first appear. 
EntryPattern 
To enable support for an entry mask for controls in the window, set 
EntryPattern to True. This lets you specify key-in entry patterns for the 
fields you choose, and adds the MASK attribute to the window.

Gray 
To provide the gray window background, chiseled control look for your 
application, set the Gray property to True. This is clearly a style 
consideration, but will go a long way in giving your application a 
professional look. This adds the GRAY attribute to the window. 
The gray background is not visible when you design your window with 
the Window Designer. It is, however, visible in test mode, and when 
your application runs. 
Immediate 
To generate a message event each time the end user moves or resizes 
the window, set the Immediate property to True. This adds the IMM 
attribute to the window. You are responsible for the code that executes 
upon notification of the event. 
MaximizeBox 
To place a maximize button in your window, set the MaximizeBox 
property to True. In general, you should place a maximize button only on 
application windows and MDI child document windows. This adds the 
MAX attribute to the window. 
MDIChild 
To add the MDI attribute to your window, set the MDIChild property to 
True. An MDI child window cannot move outside the main application 
window. A typical use of an MDI window might be to present a different 
arrangement of the data in your application's database. 
ModalWindow 
To specify a system modal window, set the ModalWindow property to 
True. A system modal window prevents all other tasks--even in 
applications other than your own--from executing until the window is 
closed. This adds the MODAL attribute to the window. 
SystemMenu 
To place a system menu in your window, set the SystemMenu property to 
True. Most windows should have a system menu. For users on a system 
without a mouse, the system menu provides the only means of minimizing, 
maximizing or re-sizing the window. This adds the SYSTEM attribute to 
the window. 
 
Even if you plan that the window should NOT have a system menu when the application is complete, it's good practice to 
place a system menu on your application while it's under development. By DOUBLE-CLICKING the system menu, or 
choosing Close, you can close your application should your normal exit procedure fail. 
Toolbox 
To add the TOOLBOX attribute to your window, set the Toolbox property 
to True. This makes your window always stay on top. See Also: DOCK  
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of a window. 
The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the size 
visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the window's Top Left Corner, choose from the following options for the X (horizontal) and Y 
(vertical) coordinates.  
Center 
Centers an APPLICATION window on the screen. Centers child windows

on their respective parents. 
Default 
The Windows operating system determines the initial position of the 
window. By default, Windows position windows in a cascading sequence 
from top-left to bottom-right. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise coordinate in Dialog units. Generally, the coordinate 
is relative to the top left corner of the screen for APPLICATION (first or 
main) windows and relative to the top left corner of the APPLICATION 
window for all subsequent (child) windows. 
 
To give your application the "standard" look of other Windows applications, where possible specify the Default setting for 
any windows with resizable frames. 
To set the window's size, choose from the following options for the Width and Height. 
Default 
The Windows operating system determines the initial size of the window. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units. Dialog units provide 
a relative screen measure based on the system font character size. 
 
Sizing all windows and controls in dialog units lets you design a screen at one resolution, and expect it to look similar at 
another--in theory. In practice, there can be differences, especially when you display bitmaps in Image controls. 
Therefore, test your applications in the popular Windows resolutions. The most popular are 640 x 480, 800 x 600, and 
1024 x 768 pixels. 
  
Scrollbars 
These options add the HSCROLL, VSCROLL, and HVSCROLL attributes to the window. 
Horizontal 
To add a horizontal scroll bar to your window, set the Horizontal 
property to True. Scroll bars only appear when something inside the 
window--a control--is bigger than the window.  
Vertical 
To add a vertical scroll bar to your window, set the Vertical property to 
True.

Class Tab Properties 
 
Classes Tab 
Many of the ABC Procedure, Control and Extension templates provide a Classes tab or dialog. These local Classes tabs 
let you control the classes (and objects) your procedure uses to accomplish the template's task—that is, they override the 
global class settings specified in the Global Properties dialog. You may accept the default Application Builder Class 
specified in the Global Properties dialog (recommended), or you may specify your own or a third party class to override 
the default setting. Deriving your own class can give you very fine control over the procedure when the standard 
Application Builder Class is not precisely what you need. 
Object Name 
Set the object's label for the template generated code. 
Use Default Application Builder Class? 
Check this box to use the default Application Builder Class specified in the Global Properties dialog. Clear this box to 
use a class other than the default, and to enable the following prompts. 
Use Application Builder Class? 
Check this box to select a class from the Base Class drop-down list. The list includes all classes with the LINK attribute in 
\LIBSRC\*.INC files. Clear this box to specify a class declared elsewhere. 
Base Class 
If you checked the Use Application Builder Class? box, select a class from the drop-down list. If you cleared the Use 
Application Builder Class? box, type the class label here, and type the name of the source file that contains the class 
declaration in the Include File entry box. 
Include File 
If you cleared the Use Application Builder Class? box, type the class label in the Base Class entry box, and type the 
name of the source file that contains the class declaration here. 
Derive? 
Check this box to derive a class based on the parent class specified above and to enable the New Class Methods and 
New Class Properties buttons to define any new properties and methods for the derived class.  
This prompt is primarily to allow you to define new properties and methods in a derived class. To override existing 
methods, simply embed code in the corresponding method embed points. 
Using Derive?, New Class Methods and New Class Properties makes the template generate code similar to the 
following: 
    MyProcess CLASS(Process)  !derive a class from the parent class 
    NewMethod  PROCEDURE    !prototype new class method 
    NewProperty BYTE      !declare new class property 
         END 
 
The template automatically derives from the parent class if you embed code into any of the derived method embed points, 
regardless of the status of this check box.  
New Class Methods 
Press this button to specify the new method prototypes to generate into the derived CLASS structure. This opens the New 
Class Methods dialog (see New Class Methods). 
New Class Properties 
Press this button to specify the new property declarations to generate into the derived CLASS structure. This opens the 
New Class Properties dialog (see New Class Properties).

Enable doublebuffering 
On some machine configurations, the drawing of multi-colored text and other items can sometime cause flicker, due to the 
multiple passes that must be performed. Check this box to enable double buffering, which draws each line of text into an 
off-screen buffer before displaying it visually. This can have an effect of slower loading in some older machines, but 
doublebuffering in most cases is recommended. 
Enable folding

Behavior 
The Behavior dialog window controls a wide spectrum of options that greatly affects your productivity in the Text editor. 
Tab size 
Enter the tab size in character size increments. Pressing the TAB key moves the caret (the place where something is to 
be inserted in a line) the specified number of characters. 
Indentation size 
Enter the indentation length in character size increments. Pressing the ENTER key indents the caret the specified number 
of characters. 
Indentation (CTRL + I) 
indentation functionality is divided into 2 essential parts: 
• 
Indentation of the existing text (Ctrl + I) or formatting after pressing the Enter key. 
• 
Cursor positioning on a new line. 
There are three modes of indentation available in the Text Editor: 
None 
Set this to turn off all indentation effects. Existing text is not indented neither automatically nor by the CTRL+I hot key. 
Cursor is always placed to the first column on a new line. 
Automatic 
With Indentation set to Automatic ,the Text Editor keeps a running indent. When you press the Enter key, spaces and 
tabs are inserted to line up the insert point under the start of the previous line. In this mode indentation is set to the 
same value as on the previous line. For example, if the text on the previous line starts from the column 8, indented 
existing text will start from the column 8 (or the cursor on a new line will be placed to the column 8). If you try to indent 
the entire text in the document (CTRL+A, CTRL+I), all lines will start from column 1. 
Smart 
After a keyword statement, the next line is indented by the tab size set (see above). After certain keywords (break, 
return etc.) the next line is "non-indented". 
Other rules for Smart include 
• 
The Preferred column number (found in the Clarion Specific Options section) identifies a column where a 
keyword will be placed if it is not located already in some code block. In other words, if the keyword should not be 
indented relative to the parent it will be placed in the preferred column. The default value is column 21. 
• 
Statements are indented from the CODE keyword position (default = on). CODE, DATA and INCLUDE (and 
USING and INLINE in Clarion#) keywords have one indent. 
• 
END is indented to the same column as a keyword in the line that opens a code block: 
• 
Keywords inside a code block have one indent from a parent keyword. For example, in the pp PROCEDURE: 
 


---

IDE Reference 
358 
• 
If a procedure inside a MAP (MODULE) is written without the PROCEDURE keyword, it will be indented: 
 
• 
Any expression that ends with a colon ":" is treated as a label in the CODE section (default = off, where colons are 
treated as an actual procedure call) 
• 
A line is indented after the Enter key is pressed at the end of the line (The default is on). 
• 
You can automatically indent several lines of pasted text (The default is off). 
• 
Source comments may also be indented (The default is off). 
• 
If previous line has line continuation character '|' the next line will have one indent from the previous one. 
• 
In the code definition section (prior to the CODE statement) the cursor is placed on column 1 on a new line. In the 
CODE section, the cursor is indented according to written statements. 
Finally, if you are transferring code from another developer, and there are different Tab Size or Convert Tabs to 
Spaces options or the code is formatted manually, you may see the erratic behavior when using Smart indentation 
mode. This is due to the line(s) formatted according to your settings but all other lines remaining unchanged. To solve 
this issue you have several options: 
1) Use the same tab size and indentation mode settings as the other developer. 
2) Reformat the code before changing it (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+I). 
3) Uncheck the Enable entered line formatting option so that the line will not be reformatted after pressing the Enter 
key. 
4) Change indentation mode to None or Automatic. 
See the Clarion Specific options dialog to control the options described above. 
Convert Tabs to Spaces 
When this option is active, all tab characters are auto converted to space characters when the document is opened. 
Can move caret behind EOL 
Checking this option allows you to move the caret marker beyond the EOL marker. 
Automatic template insertion 
This feature is not applicable to Clarion Win32 at this time. 
Auto insert curly braces 
This feature is not applicable to Clarion Win32 at this time. 
Hide mouse cursor while typing 
Check this option to hide the mouse cursor while typing. The mouse cursor will reappear when the mouse is subsequently 
moved. 
Cut or Copy entire line when nothing is selected. 
Activating (checking) this option will automatically move the entire line to the clipboard during any Cut or Copy action. 
Mousewheel direction 
This option is used to set the default scrolling direction of the mouse wheel.

Clarion specific options - General 
The options contained in this section are unique to the Clarion IDE. The Smart Indentation options located in the Text 
Editor behavior section can be customized in more detail as follows: 
Preferred column 
Identifies the preferred column position of indentation, if the line to be indented is not based on a Parent keyword (e.g., 
CODE, IF, CASE, etc.). 
Enable entered line formatting 
Indents a line after the Enter key is pressed at the end of the line. 
Indent statements from CODE 
Allows indentation to be positioned relative to the location of the CODE statement. 
Treat statement ends with colon as label 
This option tells the editor to treat expressions that ends with a colon ( : ) as a statement label in the CODE section. If this 
option is off, expressions ending with a colon are treated as a procedure call. You need to have the caret position at the 
beginning of the target statement, and then press Enter. With option on, statement is moved to column one on the next 
line. With this option off, the statement is indented. 
Indent comments 
Indicates that any commented text will be treated as other non-commented text based on the current settings. For 
example, if the "pasting" option is active below, comments will be indented when pasting. If this option is off, comments 
will not be indented when pasting. 
Format text after pasting several lines 
Auto format (e.g., indent according to your settings) pasted text if several lines are pasted.

Narrow down completion list on typing 
This option causes the typed word to act as a filtered locator for the code completion list. 
Add new line after enter in case of fully typed word 
If you press the ENTER key, and the word selected in the completion list equals the word in the typed text, a new line will 
be inserted. Otherwise, if the option is disabled, the ENTER key just closes the completion list. 
Complete word after 'insertion key' (space, dot, bracket, etc.) 
If enabled and you press a dot after partially typed word, the word will be completed. For example, you type "sys" and a 
"System" is selected in the completion list, after pressing a dot you will have "System.". If the option is disabled, you will 
have "sys.". "Insertion key" is actually any character except letters, digits and underscore (and colon in Clarion). 
Language Dependant Options 
Show completion list after a character is typed 
When active, the code completion window is automatically displayed as you type in any character that does not exist on 
column one (1). 
Trigger code completion after keywords 
Shows code completion after some of the language keywords. For example, in C# after you press SPACE after the "new", 
"as", "is", "override", etc. keywords, you will see the code completion window with suggestions (this works also if you enter 
an opening "(" after some keywords, like "for", "foreach", etc.). In Clarion/Clarion# there is only one keyword (DO) that 
triggers a completion list, and this displays a list of routines that can be called. 
Show tooltip when writing method calls 
When active, as the parameters of any method call is entered (by opening parenthesis), a tool tip pops up that offers the 
possible method parameters, if applicable. When this is active, you also have the option to Re-open tooltip with better 
overload when pressing comma. This checkbox reopens the tooltip with a more restricted set of choices, based on the 
parameters already entered. If the method is overloaded you will see all variants in the tooltip. But if you start writing the 
arguments of the method call, the number of possible variants is reduced so at the next comma the tooltip should be 
updated to show only overloads that receive typed arguments. This functionality should work in C# projects but at this 
time is not supported in Clarion.

The Window Designer places the DISABLE attribute on the control. Use 
the ENABLE statement to allow the user access to the control. 
Hide 
Makes the control invisible at the time Windows would initially display it. 
Windows actually creates the control--it just doesn't display it on screen. 
The Window Designer places the HIDE attribute on the control. Use the 
UNHIDE statement to display the control. 
Scroll 
Specifies whether the control should move with the window when the user 
scrolls the window. By default (False) the control does not move with the 
window. Set the Scroll property to False to create a control that stays 
fixed when the user scrolls the window. The Window Designer places the 
SCROLL attribute on the control when checked. 
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the control. 
The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the position 
and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer.

Button Control Properties 
A push button (BUTTON) is a rectangular area containing text and/or a picture. When the user presses the button, it 
should execute a command described by the text or picture.  
 
The Property View presents you with two ways to viewing a control’s properties.  
At the top of the Property View, press the categorized button 
 to view a control’s properties by category (the deafult). 
Or press the alphabetical button 
 to view a control’s properties in alphabetical order.  
This help documents displays the properties in the categorical view. 
Color 
Enter a valid color equate in the TextColor property or press the ellipsis (...) button to select a color from the Color dialog. 
The Window Designer adds the COLOR attribute to your control declaration. 
Text color only affects button text when an icon is present. However, Text color always affects the focus indicator (dotted 
rectangle that appears when the button has focus). 
See ..\LIBSRC\EQUATES.CLW for a list of valid color equates. See Windows Design Issues in the User's Guide for a 
discussion on using color to enhance your application.

Locked 
"Freezes" the control so that subsequent data dictionary changes are not 
applied. You can override the #Freeze attribute for all controls or for 
individual controls. See Application Options. 
Suppress 
Transparency 
 
Allows the proper display of special static parent controls when 
populated "on top of" multiple tab controls. This property is set to TRUE 
by default, and ensures a proper display regardless of Visual Styles 
used. No effect on runtime window. 
Tab Index 
Determines the index in the TAB order that this control will follow. The 
first tab in the order is index zero (0). 
To change the TabIndex property immediately while in the Designer, use 
the Show tab order interface (i.e. on the right-click menu). 
If you set the TabIndex property using the property page, the z-order is 
not updated until you save and exit the Window Designer.

Drop ID 
To specify the type of Drag operations this control will accept, type up to 
16 signatures, separated by commas. The Window Designer adds the 
DROPID attribute to the control, which indicates the control is a valid 
target for the drag and drop operations identified by the signatures. 
Icon 
In the Icon field, optionally select a standard icon, .BMP, or .GIF file. 
This displays a small bitmap on the button face (clipping or centering the 
bitmap as necessary).  
  
To select a standard icon, choose one of the named items in the drop-
down list. To select an icon file (whose extension must be .ICO), choose 
Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using the standard 
file dialog. 
Repeat 
This is how often the EVENT:Accepted occurs in hundredths of seconds 
when the end user clicks and holds the button. (The REPEAT attribute) 
## STD ID
Executes a standard action when the end user presses the button. See 
Also: STD . 
  
General 
Justification 
The Justification drop down list is used with button icons. Default 
places the icon above any text. Right-Justified places the icon to the 
right of any text. Left-Justified places the icon to the left of any text. 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of the control. Left to Right maintains the 
original layout specified in the Window Designer. Right to Left 
essentially "flips" the controls’ display as a mirror image of the layout 
specified in the Window Designer. Default field navigation moves from 
right to left. The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting 
to all child windows and controls that have the default setting active. 
Text 
The text to display on the button. Place an ampersand (&) before the 
character to act as the accelerator key for the button--this underlines the 
character as it appears on the button. 
 
Microsoft recommends you do not place an accelerator key on buttons 
labeled 'OK,' or 'Cancel.' 
TextFont 
Calls the Select Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, 
style (such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and 
strikeout) for the selected control or window. As you choose options, the 
dialog box displays a sample of the selected font.

Help 
Alert 
Press the ellipsis to open a dialog that lets you add the ALRT attribute to a 
window or control. When the attribute is set, the window generates an 
EVENT:AlertKey if the user presses the key(s) you specify in this dialog, 
while the window has the focus. 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the mouse over the button. The 
drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog. 
Help ID 
The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be either 
a Help keyword or a context string.  
  
A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search 
for it in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a 
button, if the button has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file 
opens to the referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, 
the search dialog appears. 
  
When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it 
with a leading tilde (~).  
Key  
Press the desired key or key combination (for example, CTRL+H). The 
keys you pressed will appear in the Key field, and will be supplied as 
parameters to the KEY or ALRT attribute for this control. The ESC, 
ENTER, and TAB keys cannot be specified by pressing them. For these 
keys, press the ellipsis (...) button and type "esc," "enter," or "tab." 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in the 
first zone of the status bar when the control has focus. 
Tip 
The TIP attribute on a control specifies the text to display in a "balloon 
help" box when the mouse cursor pauses over the control. Although there 
is no specific limit on the number of characters, the string should not be 
longer than can be displayed on the screen. 
  
Mode 
Disable 
Disables or 'grays-out' the control when your program initially displays it. 
The Window Designer places the DISABLE attribute on the control. Use 
the ENABLE statement to allow the user access to the control.

Scroll 
Specifies whether the control should move with the window when the user 
scrolls the window. By default (False) the control does not move with the 
window. Set the Scroll property to False to create a control that stays fixed 
when the user scrolls the window. The Window Designer places the 
SCROLL attribute on the control when checked. 
Skip 
Instructs the Window Designer to omit the control from the Tab Order. 
When the user TABS from field to field in the dialog box, Windows will not 
give the control focus. This is useful for seldom-used data fields. The 
Window Designer will place the SKIP attribute on the control.  
Transparent 
Specify whether you wish the control background to be Transparent. This 
instructs Windows to suppress the rectangular region around the text--the 
background. Normally, Windows will paint this the same uniform color as 
the window below the control. This adds the TRN attribute. 
Options 
Default Button 
"Presses" the button when the user presses the ENTER key. A heavy 
border appears around the button at runtime, to signal the default button 
to the user. In general, place the DEFAULT attribute on a button if it 
represents the most likely action the user will wish to carry out. Place only 
one default button in a window. 
Flat 
(the FLAT attribute) creates a button control which appears flat until the 
mouse cursor passes over it. This is typically used on toolbar buttons. This 
feature works best if the ICON attribute names a .GIF file. 
Immediate 
Lets you create a button control which repeats the executable action 
continuously, for as long as the user holds the button down. Normally, 
buttons generate an event only after the user presses and releases the 
mouse. See Also: the IMM attribute. 
Required 
Specifies that when pressed, your program automatically checks that all 
entry controls with the REQ attribute are neither blank nor zero. A button 
with this attribute is a 'required fields check' button. 
  
Specify this type of button when a window also contains an ENTRY or 
TEXT control field with the REQ attribute (or else use the INCOMPLETE() 
function to test the ENTRY controls). When the user presses a button with 
the REQ attribute and an ENTRY field is blank or zero, the first required 
control which is blank or zero receives the focus. 
  
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the control. 
The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the position 
and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the control's Top Left Corner, set an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinate in Dialog units. The 
coordinate is relative to the top left corner of the structure containing it, that is, the window or the report band. 
To set the control's size, choose from the following options for Width and Height.

Actions 
Use the Actions tab to provide functionality to your button. Filling in these prompts causes the button to execute an action 
when the user presses the button. 
When Pressed 
From the drop down list, choose Call a Procedure, Run a Program, or No 
Special Action. 
 
Choose No Special Action if the button is from a control template. 
  
The procedure or program you specify executes when the user pushes 
the button. The choices are: 
Call a Procedure 
You must specify the Procedure Name, and whether the procedure will 
Initiate a Thread. 
Procedure Name 
From the Procedure Name drop down list, choose an existing procedure 
name, or type a new procedure name. A new procedure appears as a 
"ToDo" item in your Application Tree. 
Initiate a Thread 
Optionally check the Initiate a Thread box. If the procedure initiates a 
thread, specify the Thread Stack size. Clarion uses the START function 
to initiate a new execution thread. You can additionally specify 
Parameters, Requested File Action, or both. 
 
A BUTTON on an application frame toolbar that calls an MDI child 
procedure must initiate a thread. 
Thread Stack 
Accept the default value in the Thread Stack spin box unless you have 
extraordinary program requirements. To change the value, type in a new 
value or click on the spin box arrows. 
Parameters 
In the Parameters field, optionally type a list of variables or data 
structures passed to the procedure. You are limited to the number of 
passed parameters supported by the START statement. Press the E 
button to call the Expression Editor. This dialog is used to help you 
construct syntactically correct expressions to use in the appropriate 
prompt. 
Requested File 
Action 
From the drop down list, optionally select None, Insert, Change, Delete, 
or Select. The default selection is None. The Global Request variable 
gets the selected value. The called procedure can then check the value 
of the Global Request variable and perform the requested file action.

Run a Program 
You must specify the Program Name, and optionally, any parameters. 
Program Name 
Type the program name. The program name must be in your path or 
current folder, else enter the full path and executable program. Quotes 
are added to your entry so you don't need to enter any. 
Parameters 
Optionally type a list of values that are passed to the program. Press the 
E button to call the Expression Editor. This dialog is used to help you 
construct syntactically correct expressions to use in the appropriate 
prompt. The variable must be preceded by an exclamation point (!). 
No Special Action 
Choose this option if you are providing your button's functionality with 
another method, such as embedded source, or an STD ID (see Extra 
Tab above). 
 
You may combine a procedure or program call with embedded source, 
but not with an STD ID.

Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. Specify a numeric variable. 
The check box places a value of 1 in the numeric variable if the end user 
turns on the check box, zero if off. 
Value 
These values are also used to set the state of the check box (checked or 
cleared) when it is first displayed. 
True Value 
Type the value to assign when the box is checked.  
False Value 
Type the value to assign when the box is cleared.  
  
True Value and False Value let you easily manage legacy data with a 
check box, or let you use character values such as "T" and "F" or "Yes" 
and "No" where appropriate. For example, if your legacy field contains 
"True" and "False" or "Y" and "N," rather than 1 and 0, then True Value 
and False Value can modify the check box's default behavior to be 
consistent with the legacy data. If you leave both fields blank, you get the 
default values and behavior, that is, 1 for checked and 0 or blank for 
cleared. 
 
True Value and False Value are case sensitive, so "True" is not the 
same as "TRUE" and "T" is not the same as "t." Also, if you are using a 
STRING variable as the USE variable for your check box, you must 
explicitly set True and False Values (here, or in the dictionary’s validity 
check for the target column).

the COMBO. You are responsible for the code that executes upon 
notification of the event. 
Mark 
Optionally enables multiple item selection. Type in the name of a 
QUEUE, field or array in the Mark field if you wish to allow the user to 
select more than one item from the list. The QUEUE field will flag the 
selected items. 
Read Only 
The READONLY attribute prevents data entry in this control. Use this to 
declare display-only data. 
Required 
The REQ attribute specifies that the control may not be left blank or zero. 
VCR 
Optionally provide VCR controls. Set the VCR property to TRUE to 
provide VCR style controls for the list box. Optionally type the name of an 
entry Field. When the user presses the Locator ( ? ) button, the focus 
shifts to that field. The user may type in data, then press TAB to scroll the 
list box to the closest matching entry. 
General 
Drop 
Specifies whether this should be a regular or drop-down combo box. 
Place a zero in the Drop field for a normal combo box. To create a drop-
down combo box, type the number of drop-down elements you wish to 
be visible. You must resize the combo box after specifying the drop 
number. 
Format 
Specifies the print or dispay format of the list box control. Press the 
ellipsis to call the Format Editor dialog. 
From 
Fill the From field with the origin of the list data. Generally, this is the label 
of a QUEUE structure.

Justification 
Specify left, center, right, decimal, or default justification. Default 
justification matches that specified in the data dictionary, if applicable. If 
you use decimal justification, you set the Offset to allow display of digits 
to the right of the decimal point. 
Offset 
Specify an indentation value for the list box item text, in dialog units. 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of the control. Left to Right maintains the 
original layout specified in the Window Designer. Right to Left 
essentially "flips" the controls’ display as a mirror image of the layout 
specified in the Window Designer. Default field navigation moves from 
right to left. The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting 
to all child windows and controls that have the default setting active. 
NoBar 
Specifies the selection bar appears only when the list box has focus. See 
Also: the NOBAR attribute. 
Picture 
Specify the picture token for the control. The picture token you specify 
appears in the format string, for example, "@S10@." Pressing the ellipsis 
button lets you select the picture token from the Edit Picture String 
Dialog. 
TextFont 
Calls the Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, style 
(such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and strikeout) for 
the selected control or window. As you choose options, the dialog box 
displays a sample of the selected font. 
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. Place a variable or field 
equate label in the Use field. You may specify the variable which will 
receive the value that the user selects. Or, a field equate label to 
reference the combo box in program statements. 
Help 
Alert 
Press the ellipsis to open a dialog that lets you add the ALRT attribute to a 
window or control. When the attribute is set, the window generates an 
EVENT:AlertKey if the user presses the key(s) you specify in this dialog, 
while the window has the focus. 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. 
The drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog. 
Help ID 
The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be 
either a Help keyword or a context string.  
  
A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search 
for it in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a 
button, if the entry box has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file 
opens to the referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, 
the search dialog appears.

When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it 
with a leading tilde (~).  
Key 
Press the desired key or key combination (for example, CTRL+H). The 
keys you pressed will appear in the Key field, and will be supplied as 
parameters to the KEY or ALRT attribute for this control. 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in 
the first zone of the status bar when the control has focus. 
Tip 
The TIP attribute on a control specifies the text to display in a "balloon 
help" box when the mouse cursor pauses over the control. Although there 
is no specific limit on the number of characters, the string should not be 
longer than can be displayed on the screen.

Windows actually creates the control--it just doesn't display it on screen. 
The Window Designer places the HIDE attribute on the control. Use the 
UNHIDE statement to display the control. 
Scroll 
Specifies whether the control should move with the window when the user 
scrolls the window. By default (False) the control does not move with the 
window. Set the Scroll property to False to create a control that stays 
fixed when the user scrolls the window. The Window Designer places the 
SCROLL attribute on the control when checked. 
Skip 
Instructs the Window Designer to omit the control from the Tab Order. 
When the user TABS from field to field in the dialog box, Windows will not 
give the control focus. This is useful for seldom-used data fields. The 
Window Designer will place the SKIP attribute on the control. . 
Transparent 
Specify whether you wish the control background to be Transparent. This 
instructs Windows to suppress the rectangular region around the text--the 
background. Normally, Windows will paint this the same uniform color as 
the window below the control. This adds the TRN attribute. 
  
Options 
Flat 
Check this box to give your list box a "flat" appearance (the list box 
control is on the same level as the window, and not recessed). Due to a 
built-in attribute to the runtime library, list boxes used in Drop List and 
Drop Combo controls are always flat and cannot be modified in the 
Formatter. 
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the control.

The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the position 
and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the control's Top Left Corner, set an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinate in Dialog units. The 
coordinate is relative to the top left corner of the structure containing it, that is, the window or the report band. 
To set the control's size, choose from the following options for Width and Height. 
Default 
The Clarion runtime library determines the size of the control based on 
the applicable font and picture token. 
Full 
The control is the full height or width of the window or report. 
Fixed 
Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units on a window, or in 
thousandths of inch, points, or millimeters on a report. 
  
ScrollBars 
Horizontal 
To add a horizontal scroll bar to your list box, set the Horizontal property 
to TRUE. Scroll bars only appear when the list of items in the list is 
bigger than the window.  
Vertical 
To add a vertical scroll bar, set the Vertical property to TRUE.  
  
These options add the HSCROLL, VSCROLL, and HVSCROLL attributes to the control.

Determines the index in the TAB order that this control will follow. The 
first tab in the order is index zero (0). 
To change the TabIndex property immediately while in the Designer, use 
the Show tab order interface (i.e. on the right-click menu). 
If you set the TabIndex property using the property page, the z-order is

DropID 
To specify the type of Drag operations this control will accept, type up to 
16 signatures, separated by commas. The Window Designer adds the 
DROPID attribute to the control, which indicates the control is a valid 
target for the drag and drop operations identified by the signatures. 
EntryMode 
Choose either Insert, Overwrite or Default. The Entry Mode applies only 
for windows with the MASK attribute set. Default accepts input according 
to the current system settings. 
TextCase 
Specify case attributes for the entry field. The entry box can automatically 
convert characters from one case to another. Uppercase automatically 
converts to all caps. Capitalize converts to proper case. Default (no 
attribute) accepts input in the case the user types it.

IDE Reference 
386 
  
General 
Justification 
Specify left, center, right, decimal, or default justification. Default 
justification matches that specified in the data dictionary, if applicable. If 
you use decimal justification, you set the Offset to allow display of digits to 
the right of the decimal point. 
Offset 
Specify an indentation value for the text, in dialog units. The indention is 
in the opposite direction from the justification. 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of the control. 
Left to Right maintains the original layout specified in the Window Designer.  
Right to Left essentially "flips" the controls’ display as a mirror image of the layout specified in the Window Designer. 
Default field navigation moves from right to left. 
The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting to all child windows and controls that have the default setting 
active. 
Picture 
The Picture field takes a display picture token that specifies input format. You may press the ellipsis (...) button next to the 
field to pick a display picture from the Edit Picture String dialog. 
You may check the user entry against the picture at two points: as the user types the data in, or when the user closes the 
dialog box. Checking the data as the user types it incurs a slight performance penalty. To do so, check the Entry 
Patterns box in the Window Properties dialog for the window in which the entry box resides. This turns the MASK 
attribute on for all controls in the window. 
If the MASK attribute is off, entry checking takes place when the user moves the focus to another control (for example, by 
TABBING to another field). 
If the user types in data in a format different from the picture, the program will attempt to determine the format, then 
convert it to match the picture (if no MASK was specified). For example, if the user types 'January 1, 1995' and the picture 
is @D1, the program formats the input to "1/1/95. If the program cannot determine the entry format, it will not update the 
USE variable. The user will receive an audible prompt (beep), and the focus will return to the entry control, ready for 
additional input. 
TextFont 
Calls the Select Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, style 
(such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and strikeout) for the 
selected control or window. As you choose options, the dialog box displays a 
sample of the selected font. 
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. Place a variable or field equate 
label in the Use field. You may specify a variable which receives the value that 
the user types. Or, a field equate label which references the entry box in 
program statements. 
Help 
Alert 
Press the ellipsis to open a dialog that lets you add the ALRT attribute to a 
window or control. When the attribute is set, the window generates an 
EVENT:AlertKey if the user presses the key(s) you specify in this dialog, while 
the window has the focus.

The PASSWORD attribute specifies non-display of data entered in this 
control. When the user types in data, asterisks are displayed for each 
character entered. 
Read Only 
The READONLY attribute prevents data entry in this control. Use this to 
declare display-only data. 
Required 
The REQ attribute specifies that the control may not be left blank or zero. 
  
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the control. 
The Position category lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the 
position and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the control's Top Left Corner, set an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinate in Dialog units. The

Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units on a window, or in 
thousandths of inch, points, or millimeters on a report. 
Actions 
The Actions tab prompts are all from the templates, in other words, the prompts you see here vary with the template used 
to create the control. Following are the standard action prompts for all entry controls. 
The standard Actions prompts are designed to provide data validation support for your entry controls. The tab is divided 
into two parallel sections. The When the Control is Selected section provides validation when the control receives focus 
(when the user TABS onto, or mouse CLICKS the control). The When the Control is Accepted section provides data 
validation when the control loses focus after data have been entered in it. The control loses focus when the user TABS off 
the control, mouse CLICKS to a different control or window, or closes the window without canceling. The two sections are 
not mutually exclusive, so you can provide validation at both points.

Lookup Key 
Type a key label from the lookup file, or press the ellipsis (...) button to select a key from the Select Key dialog. 
A lookup file is a file which contains all the valid values for the entry field, which are directly accessible through a unique 
key. 
For example, a file containing all of the customer numbers for your application could be a lookup file. The key label could 
be "CUS:KeyCustNumber". 
 
This lookup validation is easier to implement by using a single component unique key. 
  
Lookup Field 
Type the label of a component field of the lookup key, or press the ellipsis (...) button to select a field from the Select 
component from key dialog. 
This is the field within the key that contains the same value being validated. Ideally, this field is the only component of a 
unique key. 
  
Lookup Procedure 
Type a procedure name, or choose an existing procedure from the drop down list. 
This is the procedure that is called when the user enters an invalid value, and the lookup specified above fails. The usual 
purpose of this procedure is to allow the user to choose a valid value from the lookup file. 
Select procedures (or Browse procedures) generated by Clarion's Wizards) are appropriate for this purpose. Alternatively, 
you may hand-code a procedure. 
  
Procedure Parameters 
Allows you to specify parameter names (an optional list of variables separated by commas) for your update procedure, 
which you can pass to it from the calling browse procedure. You must specify the functionality for the parameters in 
embedded source code. 
Example: (LOC:HideID,GLO:AccessLevel) 
  
Advanced 
Calls the Embedded Source dialog. The only embed point shown is after the code generated to call the lookup procedure 
specified above. For more embed points, and further customization, press the Embeds button. 
Perform lookup during non-stop select 
Checking this box tells Clarion to perform the validation when the window is accepted, even if the entry control never 
received focus. From a practical viewpoint, checking this box prevents the user from entering blanks by virtue of having 
pressed the window's "OK button" without ever TABBING or CLICKING onto the entry field. 
This option is only applicable to the When the Control is Accepted section.  
Force Window Refresh when Accepted 
Checking this box ensures that everything (including formulas and other entry fields) on the window is current and up-to-
date when the user TABS off this entry control.

Transparency 
 
Allows the proper display of special static parent controls when 
populated "on top of" multiple tab controls. This property is set to TRUE 
by default, and ensures a proper display regardless of Visual Styles 
used. No effect on runtime window. 
Tab Index 
Determines the index in the TAB order that this control will follow. The 
first tab in the order is index zero (0). 
To change the TabIndex property immediately while in the Designer, use

Extra 
Bevel 
Gives a three dimensional look to the control. The box appears raised, 
depressed, or both. The Window Designer adds the BEVEL attribute to 
your control declaration. Fine tune the bevel with the following prompts: 
Outer 
A positive value makes the control appear raised above the plane of the 
window. The higher the value, the further the box is raised. A negative 
value makes the control appear depressed below the plane of the 
window. The bevel effect begins at the outer border of the box. 
Inner 
A positive value makes the control appear raised above the plane of the 
window. The higher the value, the further the box is raised. A negative 
value makes the control appear depressed below the plane of the

window. The bevel effect begins immediately inside the outer bevel. 
Style 
An integer constant or constant expression that specifies fine control of 
the bevel, overriding the signs of the outer and inner parameters 
(PROP:BevelStyle). 
Boxed 
Specifies whether to draw a visible box, containing the caption, around 
the grouped controls. When False, the Group box, including its caption, 
is invisible. 
Drop ID 
To specify the type of Drag operations this control will accept, type up to 
16 signatures, separated by commas. The Window Designer adds the 
DROPID attribute to the control, which indicates the control is a valid 
target for the drag and drop operations identified by the signatures. 
  
General 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of the control. Left to Right maintains the 
original layout specified in the Window Designer. Right to Left 
essentially "flips" the controls’ display as a mirror image of the layout

right to left. The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting 
to all child windows and controls that have the default setting active. 
Text 
Specify a string constant by typing it in the Text box. 
TextFont 
Calls the Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, style 
(such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and strikeout) for 
the selected control or window. As you choose options, the dialog box 
displays a sample of the selected font.

while the window has the focus. 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. 
The drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog.

The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be 
either a Help keyword or a context string.

A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search 
for it in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a 
button, if the entry box has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file 
opens to the referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, 
the search dialog appears.  
  
When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it 
with a leading tilde (~).  
Key 
Press the desired key or key combination (for example, CTRL+H). The 
keys you pressed will appear in the Key field, and will be supplied as 
parameters to the KEY or ALRT attribute for this control. The ESC, 
ENTER, and TAB keys cannot be specified by pressing them. For these 
keys, press the ellipsis (...) button and type "esc," "enter," or "tab." 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in 
the first zone of the status bar when the control has focus. 
Tip 
The TIP attribute on a control specifies the text to display in a "balloon 
help" box when the mouse cursor pauses over the control. Although there 
is no specific limit on the number of characters, the string should not be 
longer than can be displayed on the screen. 
  
Mode 
Disable 
Disables or 'grays-out' the control when your program initially displays it. 
The Window Designer places the DISABLE attribute on the control. Use 
the ENABLE statement to allow the user access to the control. 
Hide 
Makes the control invisible at the time Windows would initially display it. 
Windows actually creates the control--it just doesn't display it on screen. 
The Window Designer places the HIDE attribute on the control. Use the 
UNHIDE statement to display the control. 
Scroll 
Specifies whether the control should move with the window when the user 
scrolls the window. By default, (False), the control does not move with the 
window. Leave the Scroll box False to create a control that stays fixed 
when the user scrolls the window. The Window Designer places the 
SCROLL attribute on the control when checked.  
Skip 
Instructs the Window Designer to omit the control from the Tab Order. 
When the user TABS from field to field in the dialog box, Windows will not 
give the control focus. This is useful for seldom-used data fields. The 
Window Designer will place the SKIP attribute on the control.  
Transparent 
Specify whether you wish the control background to be Transparent. This 
instructs Windows to suppress the rectangular region around the text--the 
background. Normally, Windows will paint this the same uniform color as 
the window below the control. This adds the TRN attribute.

To set the location of the control's Top Left Corner, set an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinate in Dialog units. The 
coordinate is relative to the top left corner of the structure containing it, that is, the window or the report band. 
To set the control's size, choose from the following options for Width and Height. 
Default 
The Clarion runtime library determines the size of the control based on 
the applicable font and picture token. 
Full 
The control is the full height or width of the window or report.

Image Control Properties 
The Image control lets you place bitmapped and vector images in a window or report. The bitmap file formats supported 
are .BMP, .PCX, .GIF, .ICO, .CUR and .JPG. The vector file format supported is .WMF. Clarion can support up to 16.7 
million color resolution. 
You must add the PALETTE attribute to a WINDOW to support custom palettes and color depths beyond the resolution of 
the end user's machine at runtime. For example, to support a 16.7 million color palette, the proper attribute is 
## PALETTE(16777215).
The Image control cannot receive focus, nor can it generate events.

List Control Properties 
The List box is useful for presenting a great number of choices for the user. It can convey a large amount of data in a 
small area, which has led to its use as an all purpose data control. Using Clarion, you can create list boxes which look like 
spreadsheet grids, perform drag-and-drop tasks, and more. 
This section only discusses placing the list box. After you place a list box, you must format it. See the List Box Formatter

When OLE is the Control Type: 
ServerName 
The ServerName list contains registered OLE objects. The ControlType 
property gets the CREATE attribute if no Storage File is specified or them 
OPEN attribute if a Storage File is specified. Select from a list of 
registered OLE objects, such as Excel Spreadsheets, Word documents, 
PowerPoint Slides, etc. to CREATE or OPEN. 
 
When you select an OLE server, the server is automatically loaded by the Window Designer. This can be time consuming 
during the window design process. Design and draw your window first, then specify your OLE control last, or specify the 
server at run-time using property syntax rather than at design time. 
StorageFile 
Specifies the name of an OLE Compound Storage File and the object 
within it to OPEN. Separate the filename and the object name with a 
backslash and exclamation point: FileName\!ObjectName. The 
Application Generator supplies a default value for this field when you use 
the development environment to create the Compound Storage File. 
 
RIGHT-CLICK the OLE control in the Window Designer and choose Open from the popup menu to activate the specified 
OLE server in open mode. This lets you build the object independent of your application, and it automatically specifies a 
default filename\!objectname in the Storage File field. When a Storage File is specified, the object is OPENed rather than 
CREATEd. 
The OLE Server can access and manipulate the object in the storage file, but only through your application. The OLE 
Server cannot access the storage file independently of your application. Use a Storage File when you want to limit your 
user's access to the document. 
When the object is opened, the saved version of the OLE container properties are reloaded, so properties need not be 
specified for OPENed objects. 
If this field is blank, the OLE object is CREATEd rather than OPENed. 
  
When Document is the Control Type: 
Document 
The Document property replaces the ServerName list. The ControlType 
property gets the DOCUMENT or LINK attribute. Type the fully qualified 
name of the document file or press the ellipsis button (...) to select the file 
from the standard dialog. A document file is a file that is associated with a 
specific OLE server, so the application can activate that server at runtime 
(e.g.. MYBUDGET.XLS is associated with Excel). If the filename is not 
fully qualified, the application looks for it in the current directory. The 
document file should be installed on the end user's machine in the 
specified directory. 
StorageFile 
Specify the name of an OLE Compound Storage File and the object 
within it to OPEN. Separate the filename and the object name with a 
backslash and exclamation point: FileName\!ObjectName. A Storage File 
may be specified for embedded documents (DOCUMENT) but not for 
linked documents (LINK). The Application Generator supplies a default 
value for this field when you use the development environment to create 
the Compound Storage File.

specified for OPENed objects. 
If this field is blank, the OLE object is CREATEd rather than OPENed. 
Link 
Set this property to TRUE to make the OLE object a link. This generates 
the LINK attribute for the OLE control, which tells the server to update the 
original file with any changes made through your application. Set this 
property to False to make the OLE object an embed. This generates the 
DOCUMENT attribute for the OLE control, which tells the server not to 
update the original file with changes made through your application. The

displays what fits into the area defined by the OLE container control's 
AT attribute. If the object is larger than the control, only the top left 
corner displays. 
Stretch 
The OLE declaration gets the STRETCH attribute. The OLE object 
stretches to completely fill the area defined by the OLE container 
control's AT attribute. The object's aspect ratio is lost.

TextFont 
Calls the Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, style (such 
as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and strikeout) for the 
selected control or window. As you choose options, the dialog box displays a 
sample of the selected font. 
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. Type a field equate label to 
reference the control in executable code. 
Help 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate shape 
for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. The drop-down 
list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and Crosshair. To select 
an external cursor file (whose extension must be .CUR), choose Select File 
from the drop-down list, then pick the file using the standard file dialog. 
Help ID 
The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the key 
for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be either a Help 
keyword or a context string.  
  
A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search for it 
in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a button, if the 
entry box has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file opens to the 
referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, the search dialog 
appears.  
  
When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it with 
a leading tilde (~).  
Key 
Enter the desired key or key combination (for example, CTRL+H). The keys 
you pressed will appear in the Key field, and will be supplied as parameters to 
the KEY or ALRT attribute for this control. The ESC, ENTER, and TAB keys 
cannot be specified by pressing them. For these keys, press the ellipsis (...) 
button and type "esc," "enter," or "tab." 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in the 
first zone of the status bar when the control has focus. 
Tip 
The TIP attribute on a control specifies the text to display in a "balloon help" 
box when the mouse cursor pauses over the control. Although there is no 
specific limit on the number of characters, the text should not be longer than 
can be displayed on the screen.

Mode 
Disable 
Disables or 'grays-out' the control when your program initially displays it. 
The Window Designer places the DISABLE attribute on the control. Use 
the ENABLE statement to allow the user access to the control. 
Hide 
Makes the control invisible at the time Windows would initially display it. 
Windows actually creates the control--it just doesn't display it on screen. 
The Window Designer places the HIDE attribute on the control. Use the 
UNHIDE statement to display the control. 
Scroll 
Specifies whether the control should move with the window when the user 
scrolls the window. By default (False) the control does not move with the 
window. Set the Scroll property to False to create a control that stays 
fixed when the user scrolls the window. The Window Designer places the 
SCROLL attribute on the control when checked. 
Skip 
Instructs the Window Designer to omit the control from the Tab Order. 
When the user TABS from field to field in the dialog box, Windows will not 
give the control focus. This is useful for seldom-used data fields. The 
Window Designer will place the SKIP attribute on the control. 
Transparent 
Specify whether you wish the control background to be Transparent. This 
instructs Windows to suppress the rectangular region around the text--the 
background. Normally, Windows will paint this the same uniform color as 
the window below the control. This adds the TRN attribute. 
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the control. 
The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the position 
and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the control's Top Left Corner, set an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinate in Dialog units. The 
coordinate is relative to the top left corner of the structure containing it, that is, the window or the report band. 
To set the control's size, choose from the following options for Width and Height. 
Default 
The Clarion runtime library determines the size of the control based on 
the applicable font and picture token. 
Full 
The control is the full height or width of the window or report. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units on a window, or in 
thousandths of inch, points, or millimeters on a report.

Radio Button Control Properties 
A Radio button, also called an option button, provides the user one of a set of mutually exclusive choices. By default, a 
filled-in circle represents the current selection. 
A group box--an OPTION structure--must always surround the radio button choices. The Window Designer automatically 
prompts you to create this if you try to place a radio button outside an option box. When the user selects a choice, the 
control fills the USE variable with the Radio text, minus the ampersand indicating the accelerator key. 
When you place a radio button in a blank dialog window, it forces the creation of the OPTION STRUCTURE. After 
activating the Radio Button tool, or choosing Radio Button from the Control menu, CLICK in the window. An option box 
and one radio button appear. Select the radio button and press the Properties button, or RIGHT-CLICK and select 
Properties to open the Radio Button Properties dialog. 
 
The Property View presents you with two ways to viewing a control’s properties.  
At the top of the Property View, press the categorized button 
 to view a control’s properties by category (the deafult). 
Or press the alphabetical button 
 to view a control’s properties in alphabetical order.  
This help documents displays the properties in the categorical view. 
Color 
Enter a valid color equate in the TextColor or BackGround fields, or press the ellipsis (...) button to select a color from 
the Color dialog. The Window Designer adds the COLOR attribute to your control declaration. 
See ..\LIBSRC\EQUATES.CLW for a list of valid color equates. See Windows Design Issues in the User's Guide for a 
discussion on using color to enhance your application. 
  
Design 
Locked 
"Freezes" the control so that subsequent data dictionary changes are not 
applied. You can override the #Freeze attribute for all controls or for 
individual controls. See Application Options. 
Tab Index 
Determines the index in the TAB order that this control will follow. The 
first tab in the order is index zero (0). 
To change the TabIndex property immediately while in the Designer, use 
the Show tab order interface (i.e. on the right-click menu). 
If you set the TabIndex property using the property page, the z-order is 
not updated until you save and exit the Window Designer. 
Extra 
Drop ID 
To specify the type of Drag operations this control will accept, type up to 
16 signatures, separated by commas. The Window Designer adds the 
DROPID attribute to the control, which indicates the control is a valid 
target for the drag and drop operations identified by the signatures.

Icon 
In the Icon field ( ICON ), optionally select a standard icon or icon file. 
This displays a small bitmap on the button face (clipping or centering the 
bitmap as necessary).  
To select a standard icon, choose one of the named items in the drop-
down list. To select an icon file (whose extension must be .ICO), choose 
Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using the standard 
file dialog. At run time, the radio button appears as a "latched" 3D push 
button. 
General 
Justification 
Left Justification arranges the button (or icon) to the left of the 
parameter text. Right Justification arranges the button (or icon) to the 
right of the parameter text. Default arranges the button according to any 
applicable settings in the data dictionary. 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of the control. Left to Right maintains the 
original layout specified in the Window Designer. Right to Left 
essentially "flips" the controls’ display as a mirror image of the layout 
specified in the Window Designer. Default field navigation moves from 
right to left. The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting 
to all child windows and controls that have the default setting active. 
Text 
Specify a string constant to display. Place an ampersand (&) before the 
single character to set the accelerator key or mnemonic access 
character for the radio button--this underlines the label that appears next 
to the radio button. 
TextFont 
Calls the Select Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, 
style (such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and 
strikeout) for the selected control or window. As you choose options, the 
dialog box displays a sample of the selected font. 
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. The field equate label 
references the radio button in program statements. 
Value 
When the user selects a radio button, the OPTION's USE variable 
receives the value that you specify here. The value you enter should 
match the data type of the OPTION's USE variable.  
If you leave the Value field blank, the OPTION's USE variable receives 
either the string found in the Text field, or the button number, depending 
on the data type of the OPTION's USE variable. 
The button number corresponds to the button's position within the option 
box. From the Window Designer choose Edit Order Control dialog to 
see the button's tab order position within the option box.

Help 
Alert 
Press the ellipsis to open a dialog that lets you add the ALRT attribute to a 
window or control. When the attribute is set, the window generates an 
EVENT:AlertKey if the user presses the key(s) you specify in this dialog, 
while the window has the focus. 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. 
The drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog. 
HelpID 
The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be 
either a Help keyword or a context string.  
A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search 
for it in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a 
button, if the entry box has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file 
opens to the referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, 
the search dialog appears. 
When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it 
with a leading tilde (~). 
Key 
Press the desired key or key combination (for example, CTRL+H). The 
keys you pressed will appear in the Key field, and will be supplied as 
parameters to the KEY or ALRT attribute for this control. The ESC, 
ENTER, and TAB keys cannot be specified by pressing them. For these 
keys, press the ellipsis (...) button and type "esc," "enter," or "tab." 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in 
the first zone of the status bar when the control has focus. 
Tip 
The TIP attribute on a control specifies the text to display in a "balloon 
help" box when the mouse cursor pauses over the control. Although there 
is no specific limit on the number of characters, the string should not be 
longer than can be displayed on the screen. 
  
Mode 
Disable 
Disables or 'grays-out' the control when your program initially displays it. 
The Window Designer places the DISABLE attribute on the control. Use 
the ENABLE statement to allow the user access to the control. 
Hide 
Makes the control invisible at the time Windows would initially display it. 
Windows actually creates the control--it just doesn't display it on screen. 
The Window Designer places the HIDE attribute on the control. Use the 
UNHIDE statement to display the control.

Scroll 
Specifies whether the control should move with the window when the user 
scrolls the window. By default (False) the control does not move with the 
window. Set the Scroll property to False to create a control that stays 
fixed when the user scrolls the window. The Window Designer places the 
SCROLL attribute on the control when checked. 
Skip 
Instructs the Window Designer to omit the control from the Tab Order. 
When the user TABS from field to field in the dialog box, Windows will not 
give the control focus. This is useful for seldom-used data fields. The 
Window Designer will place the SKIP attribute on the control.  
Transparent 
Specify whether you wish the control background to be Transparent. This 
instructs Windows to suppress the rectangular region around the text--the 
background. Normally, Windows will paint this the same uniform color as 
the window below the control. This adds the TRN attribute. 
  
Options 
Flat 
The FLAT attribute (PROP:FLAT) specifies the BUTTON, CHECK, or 
RADIO with an ICON attribute appears flat until the mouse cursor passes 
over it. With radio buttons, this creates a "latched" button effect.  
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the control. 
The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the position 
and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer.

Picture 
The Picture field takes a display picture token that specifies input format. 
You may press the ellipsis (...) button next to the field to pick a display 
picture from the Edit Picture String dialog. 
You may check the user entry against the picture at two points: as the 
user types the data in, or when the user closes the dialog box. Checking 
the data as the user types it incurs a slight performance penalty. To do so, 
check the Entry Patterns box in the Window Properties dialog for the 
window in which the entry box resides. This turns the MASK attribute on 
for all controls in the window. 
If the MASK attribute is off, entry checking takes place when the user 
moves the focus to another control (for example, by TABBING to another 
field). 
If the user types in data in a format different from the picture, the 
program will attempt to determine the format, then convert it to match the 
picture (if no MASK was specified). For example, if the user types 
'January 1, 1995' and the picture is @D1, the program formats the input 
to "1/1/95. If the program cannot determine the entry format, it will not 
update the USE variable. The user will receive an audible prompt (beep), 
and the focus will return to the entry control, ready for additional input. 
TextFont 
Calls the Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, style 
(such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and strikeout) for 
the selected control or window. As you choose options, the dialog box 
displays a sample of the selected font. 
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. Place a variable or field 
equate label in the Use field. You may specify a variable which receives 
the value that the user selects. Or, a field equate label which references 
the spin box in program statements. 
Help 
Alert 
Press the ellipsis to open a dialog that lets you add the ALRT attribute to a 
window or control. When the attribute is set, the window generates an 
EVENT:AlertKey if the user presses the key(s) you specify in this dialog, 
while the window has the focus. 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. 
The drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog.

Help ID 
The Help ID field (the HLP attribute) takes a string constant specifying the 
key for accessing a specific topic in the Help document. This may be 
either a Help keyword or a context string.  
A Help keyword is a word or phrase indexed so that the user may search 
for it in the Help Search dialog. When you fill in the HLP attribute for a 
button, if the entry box has focus, when the user presses F1, the help file 
opens to the referenced topic. If more than one topic matches a keyword, 
the search dialog appears. 
When referencing a context string in the Help ID field, you must identify it 
with a leading tilde (~). 
Key 
Press the desired key or key combination (for example, CTRL+H). The 
keys you pressed will appear in the Key field, and will be supplied as 
parameters to the KEY or ALRT attribute for this control. The ESC, 
ENTER, and TAB keys cannot be specified by pressing them. For these 
keys, press the ellipsis (...) button and type "esc," "enter," or "tab." 
Message 
The Message field (the MSG attribute) lets you specify text to display in 
the first zone of the status bar when the control has focus. 
Tip 
The TIP attribute on a control specifies the text to display in a "balloon 
help" box when the mouse cursor pauses over the control. Although there 
is no specific limit on the number of characters, the string should not be 
longer than can be displayed on the screen. 
  
Mode 
Disable 
Disables or 'grays-out' the control when your program initially displays it. 
The Window Designer places the DISABLE attribute on the control. Use 
the ENABLE statement to allow the user access to the control. 
Hide 
Makes the control invisible at the time Windows would initially display it. 
Windows actually creates the control--it just doesn't display it on screen. 
The Window Designer places the HIDE attribute on the control. Use the 
UNHIDE statement to display the control. 
Skip 
Instructs the Window Designer to omit the control from the Tab Order. 
When the user TABS from field to field in the dialog box, Windows will not 
give the control focus. This is useful for seldom-used data fields. The 
Window Designer will place the SKIP attribute on the control.  
Scroll 
Specifies whether the control should move with the window when the user 
scrolls the window. By default (False) the control does not move with the 
window. Set the Scroll property to False to create a control that stays 
fixed when the user scrolls the window. The Window Designer places the 
SCROLL attribute on the control when checked.

Transparent 
Specify whether you wish the control background to be Transparent. This 
instructs Windows to suppress the rectangular region around the text--the 
background. Normally, Windows will paint this the same uniform color as 
the window below the control. This adds the TRN attribute. 
  
Options 
You may toggle the following options on or off independently. 
Flat 
Specifies a "flat" appearance (the spin control is on the same level as the 
window, and not recessed). 
Immediate 
Specifies immediate event generation whenever the user presses any 
key. 
Required 
Specifies that the control may not be left blank or zero. 
Read Only 
Prevents data entry in this control. Use this to declare display-only data. 
Position 
Lets you set the location and size of the control. 
The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the position 
and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the control's Top Left Corner, set an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinate in Dialog units. The 
coordinate is relative to the top left corner of the structure containing it, that is, the window or the report band. 
To set the control's size, choose from the following options for Width and Height. 
Default 
The Clarion runtime library determines the size of the control based on 
the applicable font and picture token. 
Full 
The control is the full height or width of the window or report. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units on a window, or in 
thousandths of inch, points, or millimeters on a report. 
  
ScrollBars 
Set the appearance of the Spin control buttons by checking any combination of the two Scroll Bar boxes. 
Horizontal 
Set to True to produce larger buttons arranged side by side. 
Vertical 
Set to True to produce smaller, vertically stacked buttons.  
If both properties are set to True, the result is the same as Horizontal. If both properties are False, the result is similar to 
Vertical.

The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the position 
and size visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the location of the control's Top Left Corner, set an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinate in Dialog units. The 
coordinate is relative to the top left corner of the structure containing it, that is, the window or the report band. 
To set the control's size, choose from the following options for Width and Height. 
Default 
The Clarion runtime library determines the size of the control based on 
the applicable font and picture token. 
Full 
The control is the full height or width of the window or report. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units on a window, or in 
thousandths of inch, points, or millimeters on a report. 
  
Scroll Bars 
Horizontal 
To add a horizontal scroll bar to the control, set the Horizontal property 
to True. Scroll bars only appear when the contents of the text box are 
bigger than the window. 
Vertical 
To add a vertical scroll bar, set the Vertical property to True.

Accesses the Embedded Source dialog for points surrounding the event

Toolbar Properties 
Lets you edit settings for your TOOLBAR. 
 
The Property View presents you with two ways to viewing a control’s properties.  
At the top of the Property View, press the categorized button 
 to view a control’s properties by category (the deafult). 
Or press the alphabetical button 
 to view a control’s properties in alphabetical order.  
This help documents displays the properties in the categorical view. 
Color 
Enter a valid color equate in the TextColor or Background fields, or press the ellipsis (...) button to select a color from 
the Color dialog. The Window Designer adds the COLOR attribute to your control declaration. 
See ..\LIBSRC\EQUATES.CLW for a list of valid color equates. See Windows Design Issues in the User's Guide for a 
discussion on using color to enhance your application. 
  
Design 
Locked 
"Freezes" the control so that subsequent data dictionary changes are not 
applied. You can override the #Freeze attribute for all controls or for 
individual controls. See Application Options. 
General 
Cursor 
The Cursor field (the CURSOR attribute) lets you specify an alternate 
shape for the cursor when the user passes the cursor over the control. 
The drop-down list provides standard cursor choices such as I-Beam and 
Crosshair. To select an external cursor file (whose extension must be 
.CUR), choose Select File from the drop-down list, then pick the file using 
the standard file dialog. 
Layout 
Indicates the orientation of the control. Left to Right maintains the 
original layout specified in the Window Designer. Right to Left 
essentially "flips" the controls’ display as a mirror image of the layout 
specified in the Window Designer. Default field navigation moves from 
right to left. The setting in the Application Frame will cascade its setting 
to all child windows and controls that have the default setting active. 
NoMerge 
Specifies not to merge an MDI tool bar into an application frame tool bar 
at run time. 
TextFont 
Calls the Select Font dialog which lets you select the font (typeface), size, 
style (such as bold or italic), color, and font effects (underline and 
strikeout) for the selected control or window. As you choose options, the 
dialog box displays a sample of the selected font. 
Use 
This defines the USE attribute for the control. Type a field equate label to 
reference the control in executable code, or the name of a variable.

Wallpaper-
BackgroundImage 
To provide a background image for the window's client area, specify an 
image filename. Type the filename or press the ellipsis button (...) to select 
a file. See WALLPAPER in the Language Reference. 
Mode 
Specify how the window displays the background image. Choose from: 
Stretched 
The image expands to fill the entire client area. 
Centered 
The image displays at its default size and is centered in the window's 
client area. 
Tiled 
The image displays at its default size and is repeated so it fills the 
entire client area. 
Position 
Lets you set the size of the toolbar. The toolbar is always located at the upper left corner of the window, that is, any X and 
Y coordinates are ignored. 
The Position tab lets you specify the AT attribute. Filling in the attribute manually is optional--you may set the height 
visually by dragging with the mouse in the Window Designer. 
To set the toolbar's size, choose from the following options for Width and Height. 
Default 
The Clarion runtime library determines the size of the toolbar, about 
twice the height of the window's title bar and the full width of the window. 
Value 
Lets you set a precise width or height in Dialog units. 
If the toolbar's width is less than the width of the window, the Window Designer displays a full width toolbar to remind you 
that the "unused" space to the right of the toolbar may be used when merging toolbars.
